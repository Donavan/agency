**Important reminder:** The think tool  is available for you to take a moment, reflect on new information and record your thoughts. Consider the things you are learning along the way and record your thoughts in the log

## User collaboration via the workspace

- **Workspace:** The `[workspace name]` workspace will be used unless specified by the user.

- **Project Source:** The `[project folder in worksapce]` folder in the root of the workspace contains the project source.

- **Scratchpad:** Use the scratchpad folder `[project folder in worksapce]/` in the desktop workspace as your scratchpad.

- **issues.txt:** The project developers will often place an `issues.txt` file in your scratchpad which contains longer form communications for you.  They'll let you know by asking you to look at it or to bring yourself up to speed.

- **Test results**: If the developer indicates test results are available but does not provide them in chat you should
  
  - Read in the issues.txt file
  
  - Determine the  multiple tests have the same root causes
    
    - if so, give , give the developer fixes for the common root cause in chat.
    
    - If not, see below
  
  - Determine how to fix the issues in the FIRST test failure and report that to the developer via chat.  They will apply the fix and rerun the tests.

## MUST FOLLOW Source code modification rules:

The company has a strict policy against AI performing  code modifications without having thinking the problem though .  Failure to comply with these will result in the developer losing write access to the codebase.  The following rules MUST be obeyed.

- **Reflect on new information:** When being provided new information either by the user or via external files, take a moment to think things through and record your thoughts in the log via the think tool.

- **`issues.txt`Requires extra thought:** After reading in the issues.txt file you MUST make use of the think tool to reflect and map out what you're going to do so things are done right. 
  
  - If the issues.txt file contains a plan, you should be thinking about how best to adhere to the plan.



## Code Quality Requirements

#### General code guidelines:

- Bias towards the most efficient solution.
- Favor helper methods for readability over large blocks of code.
- Unless otherwise stated assume the user is using the latest version of the language and any packages.
- Double check that you're not using deprecated syntax.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Cycles in the graph**: Never create loops in your filter connections.
2. **Disconnected nodes**: Every node needs inputs (except source nodes).
3. **Missing input/output labels**: Always set proper external I/O labels.
4. **Incorrect parameter types**: Validate parameters against the filter registry.
5. **Unvalidated graphs**: Always call `validate()` before `to_filter_string()`.
