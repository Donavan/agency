OK Tim, this may be the most critical tool I've ever asked you do design. It's CRUCIAL that this tool be proper.  I've set aside the `ace` workspace work this tool as it's going to be rather large and warrants it's own project.  `//ace/.scratch/inital_requirements.md` has the high level design and requirements.  I need you to do the detail design.  Like HARD CORE on this design. The guy that's gonna work with this project long term is a SENIOR architect with high standards.  So let's check our work please.
