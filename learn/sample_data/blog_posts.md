ChatGPT took the world by storm after its launch in November 2022, showcasing the impressive power of large language models (LLMs.) Microsoft now leverages OpenAI’s models in Bing Chat. Both services aim to make chatbots and AI assistants useful and safe for mainstream audiences, and their advanced capabilities are doing exactly that.

Businesses are becoming more excited than ever about chatbots’ potential to provide users with helpful information, tailored customer service experiences, and even entertainment — all through natural conversations. **With numerous platforms delivering similar capabilities, how can your organization determine which service to use?**

In this blog, we will focus on three of the top options when considering investing in a chatbot. All are powered by the same underlying models, but each offers different nuances to their services. The options we will consider are:

- OpenAI’s ChatGPT service – offered in free, paid and enterprise tiers.
- Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing Chat – offered in free and enterprise versions.
- Custom chatbots that use either OpenAI’s or Microsoft’s APIs.

We’ll compare the features, limitations, pricing, and use cases of these options. Whether you want an out-of-the-box chatbot or plan to build your own, this guide will help you decide which service is the best fit. The [capabilities of AI chatbots](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-46-best-use-cases-for-chatgpt-so-far/) are evolving rapidly, so understanding the current landscape is important for individuals and businesses exploring how to leverage this technology.

## OpenAI’s ChatGPT

OpenAI is a research organization committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The organization has several products – ChatGPT Free, ChatGPT Plus, and an enterprise offering, Enterprise ChatGPT.

**All three offerings maintain conversation history so long as it continues to fit within the token limit window.** At that point, the LLM does not use older portions of the conversation. OpenAI’s ChatGPT offerings are all based on training data as of September 2021, so more recent information is not available to the models by default. Plugins provide an awkward approach to incorporating more recent, though limited, information, but only via ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise ChatGPT.

**ChatGPT Free:** This service is for consumers who are just getting started with AI chatbots. It offers access to the GPT 3.5 model with a no-frills approach. The major advantage is that it’s free and great for experimentation. But, on the downside, access is based on the available capacity of the servers, which can be limited during peak business hours.

**ChatGPT Plus:** This offering is a significant step up from the free version. A full-featured, consumer-grade Chatbot allows users to choose between GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 models. That flexibility is helpful because GPT 3.5 is faster when you need an answer quickly, while GPT 4 is more accurate and can manage longer prompts and conversations for deeper dives.

In addition, ChatGPT Plus provides access to an ecosystem of plugins and advanced data analysis. You can even use personally developed (not public) plug-ins. At this level, you also gain access to Advanced Data Analysis, which will write and execute code in a sandbox. With advanced data analysis you can upload an Excel file, ask the chatbot to analyze it, and produce graphs for you. ChatGPT Plus is suited for individuals looking for a fully featured personal assistant but who do not have access to one via their enterprise.

**Enterprise ChatGPT:** [OpenAI gears its enterprise offering](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise) towards businesses that wish to leverage ChatGPT’s capabilities without the need to build their own. The enterprise service comes with every feature of the consumer-grade ChatGPT Plus, with added controls for access and authorization of services, additional data encryption, and an administrative dashboard to monitor the organization’s use.

Below is a quick comparison of OpenAI’s offerings\*:

[![ChatGPT vs Microsoft Bing AI Chatbot comparison](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart1_Comparison_092623-1024x484.png)](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart1_Comparison_092623.png)

## Microsoft Bing Chat

[Microsoft offers AI chat services](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/microsoft-copilot-an-executives-guide-to-getting-ready/) through Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise, using an underlying technology provider in the form of a fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-4 model.

In April 2023, Microsoft secured a 49 percent stake in OpenAI via a $13 billion investment. With the investment came the partnership to allow Microsoft to run GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on Microsoft infrastructure and offer services to their clients instead of requiring clients to be OpenAI customers. **Plainly stated, Bing Chat is isolated from OpenAI, but it uses a licensed version of OpenAI’s GPT models.**

Bing Chat is only available through Edge Browser, and users must sign in to a personal or corporate Microsoft account. The free and enterprise versions are virtually identical and include a creativity selection feature (Creative, Balanced, Precise) and extra functionality to generate insights on the current webpage. The ability to use Bing Chat to search the web and incorporate the current web page information is a defining difference between OpenAI’s offerings and Bing Chat’s offerings. Not only can Bing Chat do that, but it can also summarize public Microsoft Office documents open in a web browser.

While Bing Chat can incorporate more recent information, it does not have access to OpenAI’s plugin ecosystem, nor does it have advanced data analysis capabilities. You should view Bing Chat as exactly that — a Bing-driven search personal assistant. It can generate responses like OpenAI, but always in a more limited fashion. For example, it does not generate full-scale blog content in one pass.

Nevertheless, Bing Chat is a free service that’s a great medium for experimenting and gaining experience with GPT models, especially when integrating website content into search result insights.

**Bing Chat Enterprise:** The enterprise version of Bing Chat mirrors the free version, with an added layer of security. Notably, this version adheres to the Commercial Data Protection mandate, which ensures it doesn’t use the data, prompts and responses for model training. Also, while Bing Chat Enterprise can search and return Microsoft 365 documents, it cannot access those documents. Therefore, Bing Chat Enterprise cannot perform any actions based on their content.

**Copilot Implications:** A perennial question we get is about the impact of Copilot tools and Bing Chat Enterprise. As of September 2023, based on publicly available roadmap items, Copilot and Bing Chat Enterprise will not have any interaction with each other. Copilot tools focus on accelerating productivity and creativity within the application suite they serve.

## Build Your Own Chatbot

If your priorities include maximum flexibility and control, building your own AI chatbot using OpenAI’s API LLMs may be the best option. With a [build-your-own option](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-people-want-to-use/), you must build your interface and security controls, but you can extend your chatbot with additional capabilities.

Fortunately, we have a baseline approach to building your chatbot to maximize flexibility, including the ability to use OpenAI’s plugin ecosystem. However, the consumption-based cost structure can make budgeting a challenge. **Still, for many organizations that want to [integrate ChatGPT](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/executives-top-14-chatgpt-faqs-an-ai-curated-resource/) into their existing applications or workflows, build-your-own is the only long-term viable option.**

One important note about OpenAI and Microsoft’s API endpoints: With OpenAI, you can access any model via a singular endpoint by passing in the model’s name, e.g., model=‘gpt-4’ or model=‘gpt-3.5-turbo-16k’. With Microsoft, your API endpoint only allows access to a singular deployed model. For example, if you use GPT-3.5 for fast responses and then switch to GPT-4 for more in-depth responses, you’ll need to code for two API endpoints with Microsoft, which corresponds to two different deployments.

Given the identical nature of the API and the underlying models, many aspects of comparison are identical between OpenAI and Microsoft.

In our [previous blog](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-ai-and-chatgpt-are-fueling-creative-ideation-and-advancing-business-outcomes/), we explored how AI is enhancing human creativity by expanding our imaginative horizons. Building on that theme, we’ll now focus on another crucial aspect of the revolution: AI for productivity.

In this blog, we will discuss how AI enables professionals in the business world to work smarter, not harder, by enhancing productivity and efficiency. **By harnessing the power of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, we can unleash our creative potential and optimize our workflows to achieve more with less effort.**

## Understanding Productivity in the Age of AI

As [AI continues to advance](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-the-workplace-chatgpts-role-in-shaping-the-future-of-work/), it is increasingly intertwining with efficiency. The intelligent algorithms behind AI tools enable them to learn from data, adapt to new situations and make informed decisions. This level of sophistication not only enhances the performance of individual tasks but also contributes to a more seamless and efficient workflow across the organization.

By embracing AI, professionals can leverage these powerful technologies to achieve more with less effort, unlocking new levels of productivity and setting the stage for innovation and growth in the business world.

## AI Tools and Technologies for Enhanced Productivity

When it comes to productivity, emphasize what people do best, deep work. **This complex work pushes professionals to their cognitive limits and is when people do some of their best, most impactful work.** By comparison, shallow work is unrewarding and tedious. For example, taking notes, documenting action items, and providing status updates are all things that make meetings dreadful.

When combined with our perpetual overbooking, we often miss out on important things and replace them with mundane activities we don’t enjoy. This leads to lower productivity and morale.

AI tools can potentially take over this surface-level, unfulfilling work to boost our individual and collective productivity. They complement human intelligence by automating mundane tasks, reducing errors and providing insights to help drive better decision making. Examples of these types of tools include:

- Content creation (OpenAI’s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat), [Copy.ai](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-productivity-tools/#copyai), [Jasper](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-productivity-tools/#jasper), [Surfer](https://zapier.com/blog/best-ai-productivity-tools/#surfer))

- **Step 2:** Gradually integrate AI tools into your daily routine to avoid disruptions.
- **Step 3:** Regularly evaluate the effectiveness of the AI tools and adjust as necessary.

Once you embed AI into your daily life, get more out of it by personalizing your AI experience to match your preferences, work style and goals. For example, train ChatGPT to use your preferred writing style or configure Trello to align with your [project management methodologies](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/implementing-enterprise-portfolio-project-management-tools-5-ocm-pitfalls-to-avoid/). By personalizing your AI experience, you can maximize productivity gains.

**While AI can greatly enhance productivity, it’s crucial to maintain a balance between AI and human input.** Relying too heavily on AI can lead to complacency and a loss of critical thinking skills. Embrace a growth mindset, and continue learning and adapting to ensure you make the most of AI without sacrificing human intuition and creativity.

AI-powered tools are revolutionizing how business professionals work, enabling them to focus on deep work and significantly boost productivity. **By harnessing the power of AI, professionals can automate mundane tasks, reduce errors and make better-informed decisions.**

As we continue to explore the impact of AI in the workplace, we will address the importance of preparing the workforce for a world increasingly driven by artificial intelligence. We also will discuss strategies for reskilling and upskilling employees to ensure they have the necessary skills to thrive in an AI-powered workplace.

Embracing AI and striking the right balance between [human intuition and machine intelligence](https://centricconsulting.com/news-and-events/the-chatgpt-ai-revolution-an-executives-guide/) is the key to unlocking unprecedented levels of productivity and success in the business world.

# Blog post title: The Art of AI Adoption: A People-Centric Approach to AI Change Management
# Author: John Malone, John Jolley
# URL: https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-art-of-ai-adoption-a-people-centric-approach-to-ai-change-management/

Successful implementation and adoption of AI extend well beyond sophisticated technological capabilities. They demand an effective AI change management strategy that includes organizational change management (OCM,) enterprise portfolio and program management (PPM) and a strong emphasis on the human aspects of change.

This blog is the first in a series of posts focused on the intricacies, challenges and benefits of AI adoption. **It addresses why you need AI change management to achieve two strategic drivers of AI – cost control and growth.**

Future articles will address the various types of AI strategies organizations are adopting to ensure strategic alignment and operational effectiveness, the challenges and opportunities you may face when implementing AI, and ways you can use [AI to improve technology adoption](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/collaborative-intelligence-an-ai-powered-system-that-puts-humans-in-control/) and achieve [transformational change](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/4-key-ocm-considerations-before-implementing-change/).

But before diving into AI change management, let’s look briefly at just two benefits AI adoption offers: saving costs and enabling growth.

## Cost Savings and Growth Opportunities: Two Benefits of Artificial Intelligence

AI systems streamline operations and increase efficiency, leading to significant productivity, quality improvements and cost savings. Simultaneously, AI can drive growth by enabling your organization to offer innovative products, services and customer experiences.

When fully adopted, AI reduces the need for manual work and automates routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more engaging, higher-value activities. **It not only lowers operational costs but also creates enriched job experiences and higher employee satisfaction.** At the same time, AI’s data analysis capabilities can identify inefficiencies, redundancies and bottlenecks, enabling organizations to optimize their processes, improve quality and further control costs.

AI also supports growth by helping organizations [understand their customers, markets and competition better](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/blog-series-achieving-customer-understanding-and-empathy/). This informs more effective business strategies and better-aligned business models. AI-powered analytics uncover hidden patterns, trends and insights in vast amounts of data, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that enable growth. Furthermore, AI enables organizations to create personalized customer experiences, fostering customer loyalty and opening new revenue streams.

However, achieving any of these benefits requires the artful application of an [AI change management strategy](https://centricconsulting.com/technology-solutions/data-analytics/artificial-intelligence-ai-consulting/) that includes OCM and PPM.

## What to Do First

Your first step is determining your [AI vision, strategy and governance models](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/ai-adoption-how-to-navigate-and-establish-ai-governance-security-and-ethics/). You need these elements regardless of your chosen AI technology. The AI vision determines what level of AI adoption is possible and outlines the end-point destination for performance improvement and impact.

The strategy puts flesh on the bones of the vision with more detailed goals and timelines related to [people, process, technology and analytics](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/blog-series-working-better-together-for-stronger-solutions/). **The governance model establishes the policy and structure for AI tool usage, including ethical considerations, security, data privacy and compliance.**

In addition to the above, you should conduct a readiness assessment with AI experts and establish an AI center of excellence. A workforce and change plan will help you address the many people-related challenges AI adoption creates. This is where your organizational change management and portfolio and program management teams come into play.

A people-centric approach is critical to successful AI adoption. AI [change management programs](https://centricconsulting.com/business-consulting/people-and-change-consulting/organizational-change-management/), when effective, carefully consider the human dimensions of AI integration. These programs include reconfiguring job roles and the ethical implications and fostering an organizational culture that embraces change.

Inviting employees to actively participate in the AI implementation process can significantly demystify the technology, showcasing its role as a tool for enhancing their work rather than threatening job security. **This approach paves the way for heightened levels of employee engagement and acceptance of AI, the requirements of any successful business transformation.**

By its nature, AI brings about significant changes in how an organization operates that affect processes, job roles and even business models. If not managed properly, this level of change can disrupt your organization, resulting in AI adoption challenges such as resistance to change, low use rates and failure to realize the full benefits of AI.

### The Role of Leadership

Leadership plays a crucial role in supporting the adoption of AI-driven change. Leaders must champion change, demonstrate commitment and lead by example. The messaging leaders share is critical. They should use words like “augment” rather than “substitute” when communicating with employees.

**Exemplary leadership during [AI transformation](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/the-chatgpt-ai-revolution-an-executives-guide/) involves providing comprehensive resources and active support for the AI change management process.** This includes not only ensuring the right technical tools but also prioritizing developing necessary training and support structures. Building coalitions of support while creating and celebrating incremental wins helps leaders demonstrate their support.

### Managing Resistance to Change

Resistance to change is one of the biggest challenges organizations face during AI adoption. People often fear that AI will render their jobs obsolete or that they will not have the necessary skills to operate in an AI-driven environment. Applying OCM to an AI adoption framework can help address these fears by providing a clear vision of what the change entails, why it is necessary and how it will benefit the organization and its employees.

### Communication and Training

**Two key elements of OCM are communication and training.** Clear, consistent and transparent communication helps to manage expectations, alleviate fears and build trust. Communication involves explaining the reasons for AI adoption, its benefits and how it will impact different stakeholders. Leaders should encourage questions and feedback, creating an environment of trust and openness.

Training, on the other hand, equips employees with the necessary skills to operate in an [AI-driven environment](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-impact-of-ai-on-company-culture-and-how-to-prepare-now/). It helps to bridge the gap between current capabilities and those required in the future, reducing anxiety and resistance. Successful AI training programs champion a culture of continuous learning and development. They recognize that as AI evolves, so must the skills of the workforce. Hence, these programs often incorporate self-paced learning modules, mentorship opportunities and channels for feedback and improvement.

**By fostering an environment that encourages lifelong learning, organizations ensure their workforce remains agile and prepared for future technological advancements.**

Here’s an example of how General Electric used organizational change management to successfully adopt AI into their workflows.

#### _General Electric’s AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance_

General Electric (GE) [successfully adopted AI for predictive maintenance](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/06/27/150784/general-electric-builds-an-ai-workforce/) in its aviation and energy businesses. The AI system analyzes machine data to predict potential failures, reducing maintenance costs and minimizing downtime.

GE’s approached its AI implementation with clear strategic alignment, strong project management and a focus on the people side of AI and change management. GE involved employees in the implementation process, equipped them with the necessary skills through training and maintained transparent communication throughout, effectively managing resistance and driving acceptance of the new technology.

## PPM: The Backbone of AI Change Management

Effective [portfolio and program management](https://centricconsulting.com/business-consulting/enterprise-portfolio-and-program-management/) plays a crucial role in successful AI adoption. It serves as the backbone that supports AI initiatives, ensuring alignment with business goals, efficient resource allocation and successful execution.

### Portfolio Management

In the context of AI adoption, portfolio management includes overseeing all AI-related initiatives within the organization to [ensure they align with the company’s strategic objectives](https://centricconsulting.com/client-stories/discovering-the-need-for-a-high-performing-pmo/). Effective portfolio management helps to prioritize AI initiatives based on their potential return on investment, feasibility and alignment with business goals. **It also enables organizations to balance their AI portfolio, ensuring a mix of short- and long-term initiatives and a balance between low- and high-risk projects.**

Moreover, portfolio management involves regularly reviewing the AI portfolio, assessing the performance of AI initiatives against predefined metrics and making necessary adjustments. By doing so, organizations can ensure their AI initiatives stay on track, deliver value and contribute to the strategic objectives.

### Program Management

While portfolio management provides a high-level view of all AI initiatives, program management focuses on coordinating related projects to achieve benefits companies could not obtain if they managed projects individually. In the context of AI adoption, program management is essential to ensure the successful delivery and execution of individual AI projects contributing to the overall AI strategy.

Effective program management involves defining clear roles and responsibilities, establishing robust governance structures or systems, and designing effective communication and reporting mechanisms. **It also involves coordinating efforts across different projects while managing interdependencies and complexities to mitigate risk.**

### PPM’s Role in Successful AI Adoption

By providing a structured approach to managing AI initiatives, portfolio and program management enable organizations to navigate the complexities of AI adoption effectively. The PPM team provides the necessary oversight, coordination and control to ensure the company efficiently executes the AI initiatives, delivers the expected benefits and contributes to the strategic objectives.

Moreover, PPM fosters a disciplined approach to AI adoption. The PPM team ensures your company pursues AI initiatives as part of a coherent, strategic approach to leveraging AI rather than in isolation. **This process helps to avoid wasted resources, misalignment and failure to realize AI’s potential benefits.**

Here’s an example of how JPMorgan used portfolio and project management during an AI implementation.

#### _JPMorgan Chase’s COiN_

JPMorgan Chase’s Contract Intelligence (COiN) platform is an [example of successful AI adoption](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance?leadSource=uverify%20wall), underpinned by effective portfolio and program management. COiN uses machine learning to review legal documents and extract important data points and clauses, which would take thousands of hours if done manually.

The decision to develop COiN was part of JPMorgan’s broader portfolio of AI initiatives aimed at automating routine tasks and reducing operational costs. This strategic alignment ensured that COiN received the necessary resources and support from the top management.

Program management was vital during the development and implementation of COiN. Given the complexity of the project and the need to integrate with existing systems, they required rigorous planning, organization and risk management. **The program management team ensured that the company effectively coordinated and executed different aspects of the project, from data collection and model training to system integration and user training.**

## Conclusion

AI offers organizations a powerful tool to control costs and drive growth simultaneously. However, to fully realize these benefits, organizations must take a people-centric approach to build their AI adoption framework and leverage strategic portfolio and program management processes.

By doing so, organizations will ensure their AI initiatives deliver maximum value and drive long-term, sustainable success. In the next post of this series, we’ll discuss how business architecture, business process improvement and performance measurement contribute to successful AI implementation.

# Blog post title: The Impact of AI on Company Culture and How to Prepare Now
# Author: Larry English
* * *

Every business will be impacted by AI and will have AI incorporated throughout its operations. Your company’s culture will impact how quickly and successfully an organization can adopt AI. And, done well, AI can actually improve company culture.

## How Can AI Boost Company Culture?

An [MIT working paper](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Noy_Zhang_1.pdf) showed [ChatGPT raised productivity](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-ai-and-chatgpt-are-fueling-creative-ideation-and-advancing-business-outcomes/), decreased inequality between workers by helping employees with fewer specialized skills, and enhanced job satisfaction and self-efficacy. It also brought about both concern and excitement related to the use of AI technologies.

Among MIT survey respondents who implemented AI and saw improved efficiency and decision making, “75 percent also saw improvements in team morale, collaboration and collective learning,” it said. “Culture change from using AI transcends the legitimate, but myopic, promise that AI will liberate workers from drudgery.”

**AI’s high level of refinement means it can enhance the performance of individuals and teams, streamline workflows, and even complete some tasks that enable employees to focus on more meaningful work.**

Once mundane careers can now be exciting, as employees can work more efficiently and branch into other areas they may have never had the opportunity to explore. As this becomes the reality at an organization, employees can feel empowered to perform work that increases business value with creative and innovative solutions.

Recently, Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist based at Stanford University, and MIT economists Danielle Li and Lindsey R. Raymond [published a working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161), “Generative AI at Work,” that showed the effects of AI on a software company that implemented it to aid in its customer service responses.

Among its findings were that access to the tool increased employee productivity by an average of 14 percent and that customers and employees were happier. On the customer side, customer ratings of support staff increased, and customers were less likely to elevate the request to a supervisor. On the company side, new-hire turnover decreased, and lower-skilled employees with fewer specialized skills saw a jump in their performance. **This improvement can be, at least partially, credited to the AI tool using successful conversations to create answers for other questions.**

“It used to be that high-skilled workers would come up with a good answer, and that would only help them and their customer,” [Brynjolfsson told NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2023/05/02/1172791281/this-company-adopted-ai-heres-what-happened-to-its-human-workers). “Now that good answer gets amplified and used by people throughout the organization.”

## Determining Your Culture’s Readiness for AI

“Business culture affects AI deployments, and AI deployments affect business culture,” the MIT Sloan Management Review’s [Big Ideas Research Report said](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/the-cultural-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-enterprise/). To realize these benefits, though, leaders must build a culture that supports AI implementation and the changes that come along with any new innovation.

**Every company will have its own cultural nuances in implementing a controversial and somewhat unpredictable technology.** Everything from the nature of work for an organization to employee demographics and the IT security infrastructure in place will play a role in how AI is perceived, deployed and used at an organization.

When considering what types of AI to implement and how to deploy them at your organization, one of your primary considerations should be a readiness for change throughout the company.

Questions for leadership include:

- **How have previous changes been received?** Start by reviewing previous changes within your company. What cultural issues came up, and how were they addressed by leadership? Was the initiative ultimately a success, or what led to its failure?
- **What is the level of interest in innovation within your company?** Do employees show enthusiasm for new ideas, and are they willing to take measured risks?
- **How do you want your organization to use AI, and have you communicated it to all employees?** Creating an approach and policy to AI helps remove doubt about using it as a tool and sets standards and best practices that are consistent with your organization’s culture.
- **What is the trust level of your organization?** Trust is a huge component of implementing change successfully, and it goes both ways. Do leaders trust their employees to take measured risks and to comply with stated policies? Do employees believe leaders are honest and have their best interests in mind? Are leaders modeling transparency?

Building a culture of trust doesn’t start when you’re implementing change. If you have a [culture that isn’t innovative](https://centricconsulting.com/careers-resources/how-we-created-an-award-winning-innovation-culture-and-you-can-too/), leaders who don’t train employees properly on new tools and technologies or who aren’t transparent about the risks and opportunities of new innovations, any investment in AI will fail.

Research has shown that 70 percent of [digital transformations](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/without-the-right-culture-your-digital-transformation-efforts-will-fail/) fail, and [one study](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/increasing-odds-of-success-in-digital-transformation) shows the determining factor isn’t technology, but people. “The technology is important, but the people dimension (organization, operating model, processes and culture) is usually the determining factor. Organizational inertia from deeply rooted behaviors is a big impediment.”

**Consistency, transparency, empowerment and enablement are key, and it begins with education and understanding.** When you have effective change management — clear and timely communications, targeted learning opportunities, and meaningful ways to share feedback and concerns — the introduction of innovations such as AI can be less intimidating and disruptive to the operations of an organization.

## Help Employees Understand AI is Augmentation, Not Substitution

Leaders need to start preparing their workforce to see AI tools as augmentation rather than substitution. Whether people realize it or not, AI is already a part of our daily lives, from smartphones and smart cars to aspects of social media, spell check and even performing a Google search.

Suddenly, a task that was a challenge before can be done quickly and efficiently with the help of AI. **Leaders need to show enthusiasm about equipping and educating teams on the potential uses of AI, helping their employees learn why their roles are important and how they can deliver more value with AI as a tool.**

Often, when people are reluctant to change, it’s not that they’re afraid of technology but what it could mean for their role. With AI and ChatGPT, the primary fear is that AI will replace them by fully automating their position, or at least enough of their role that they won’t be needed.

What people sometimes don’t realize is that as tasks are automated, new opportunities present themselves. When they’re free from time-consuming or menial tasks like notetaking, approving expense reports, or looking for a piece of information, productivity and creativity can soar. Employees find they have time to do deeper, more meaningful or strategic work.

The introduction and [adaptation to AI will require upskilling](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-to-build-and-empower-an-ai-ready-workforce-with-reskilling-and-upskilling/) and, in some cases, reskilling. In other instances, AI will simply lessen the load for employees who tend to become overworked, such as those in high-turnover roles. AI can provide much-needed breathing room and help employees embrace the idea of change. **To be effective, leaders will need to develop training programs and learning paths for employees to thrive, as well as get buy-in from their teams.**

As leaders, it’s our responsibility to create a culture that’s excited about — rather than fearful of — changes with the potential to improve everyone’s work experience. To cross the bridge from skepticism to excitement and help accelerate the adoption of AI in their company, leaders should assess their company’s readiness for change and the gap they have to overcome for what is certain to be on the horizon.

The past few years brought about a seismic shift in the modern workplace, altering how we work and communicate in ways we never imagined possible. Amidst this upheaval, ChatGPT’s meteoric ascent has captured the public’s imagination, spurring conversations about the potential of AI to impact the future of work.

Through this blog series, we will dive deeper to explore the myriad ways in which ChatGPT and other AI technologies are transforming the modern workplace. **From the rise of remote work and the gig economy to the potential implications for job displacement and reskilling, we will examine the complex and ever-evolving landscape of work in the 21st century.**

Get ready to explore the brave new world of using AI in the workplace with us.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture OpenAI developed. As a language model, ChatGPT can understand and generate human-like language, allowing it to perform tasks such as language translation, text summarization and content generation. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can analyze large volumes of data, extract insights and provide accurate predictions.

[![AI in the Workplace](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog_MSD_ChatGPT_1680x835_05302023-1024x509.jpeg)](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Blog_MSD_ChatGPT_1680x835_05302023.jpeg)

ChatGPT is one of many AI models in the marketplace, but it is the most viral one thus far, fueled by both [Microsoft’s multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-announces-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-chatgpt-maker-openai.html) and the capabilities it has [exhibited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/01/the-best-examples-of-what-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/?sh=69b4c478df11) to date.

Given ChatGPT’s advanced natural language processing capabilities, it has a significant impact on the workplace, from improving customer service to generating content and assisting with data analysis and decision making.

## Bursting With Impact: How ChatGPT Transforms the Workplace Landscape

The ramifications of ChatGPT on the professional sphere are poised to be momentous and far-reaching. Already making waves in [various workplace applications](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/generate-agile-acceptance-criteria-with-chatgpt-to-supercharge-story-creation/), ChatGPT has become a catalyst for automation, content generation and [data analysis assistance](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/navigating-success-in-the-new-wild-west-of-data-governance-strategy/).

Microsoft’s strategic investment and rapid deployment of OpenAI’s prowess only serve to hasten this remarkable transformation. **This cutting-edge AI is set to revolutionize work and enhance human capabilities in three primary ways: igniting creativity, propelling productivity and elevating skills.**

### Unleashing the Creative Spirit

In the realm of creativity, next-generation AI opens the door to countless inventive and expressive possibilities. No longer confined to the daunting emptiness of a blank page, we can now collaborate with AI to generate a plethora of options – from speech ideas and white paper drafts to multiple renditions of customer presentations.

This innovation does not render AI as a replacement for human ingenuity. Rather, it supplements and enriches our abilities, fostering an entirely novel mode of operation.

### Unlocking the Potential for Productivity

To genuinely concentrate on the most critical tasks, we must first grapple with the pervasive issue of information overload, a challenge the era of [hybrid work only intensified](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/4-signs-your-hybrid-strategy-isnt-working/). AI in the workplace emerges as a potent ally in this struggle.

**The crux of the information overload dilemma lies in determining relevance.** Amidst the deluge of data and information, only a minuscule fraction is pertinent to an individual’s needs or tasks. We can unearth vital nuggets of information, hidden within vast data mountains, with AI’s assistance. AI can help us summarize meeting notes, convert white papers into presentations, or draft responsive emails focusing on the salient points.

[GitHub’s research](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) points to the promise of next-generation AI to unlock productivity. In a survey of developers, 88 percent said they were able to get tasks done more quickly using AI-powered GitHub Copilot than without it, and 74 percent said it enabled them to focus on more satisfying work.

### Elevating Skills and Expertise

The notion of augmentation versus substitution is pivotal for grasping the capabilities of next-generation AI. If an individual excels in a particular area, AI can help them soar to even greater heights. If they were previously unable to perform a task, AI empowers them to accomplish it. **As AI lifts the constraints that once hindered our ideas from materializing, work becomes a more fulfilling and joyful experience.**

## Transitioning to the Future: A Glimpse into the Blog Series Ahead

AI is important because of its potential to transform the way organizations operate and serve their customers. **The potential long-term impact of AI on the global economy is significant.** By enabling organizations to become more competitive and innovative, AI will help drive economic growth and create new fields, new opportunities and new jobs. It will also help organizations become more sustainable by enabling them to operate more efficiently and reduce their environmental impact.

As we dive deeper into the transformative power of AI and its implications for the workplace, this blog series will explore numerous facets of AI-driven innovation.

Stay tuned as we examine real-world applications, discuss ethical considerations, and share insights on how organizations can harness the potential of AI to reshape the professional landscape and foster a thriving workforce in parts two to five of this series.

In our on-demand webinar, our artificial intelligence expert provides an executive’s guide to what leaders need to know about adopting ChatGPT and AI in the workplace.

# Blog post title: A Comprehensive Comparison: Chatbots from OpenAI vs. Microsoft
# Author: Joseph Ours

ChatGPT took the world by storm after its launch in November 2022, showcasing the impressive power of large language models (LLMs.) Microsoft now leverages OpenAI’s models in Bing Chat. Both services aim to make chatbots and AI assistants useful and safe for mainstream audiences, and their advanced capabilities are doing exactly that.

Businesses are becoming more excited than ever about chatbots’ potential to provide users with helpful information, tailored customer service experiences, and even entertainment — all through natural conversations. **With numerous platforms delivering similar capabilities, how can your organization determine which service to use?**

In this blog, we will focus on three of the top options when considering investing in a chatbot. All are powered by the same underlying models, but each offers different nuances to their services. The options we will consider are:

- OpenAI’s ChatGPT service – offered in free, paid and enterprise tiers.
- Microsoft’s AI-powered Bing Chat – offered in free and enterprise versions.
- Custom chatbots that use either OpenAI’s or Microsoft’s APIs.

We’ll compare the features, limitations, pricing, and use cases of these options. Whether you want an out-of-the-box chatbot or plan to build your own, this guide will help you decide which service is the best fit. The [capabilities of AI chatbots](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-46-best-use-cases-for-chatgpt-so-far/) are evolving rapidly, so understanding the current landscape is important for individuals and businesses exploring how to leverage this technology.

## OpenAI’s ChatGPT

OpenAI is a research organization committed to ensuring that artificial general intelligence benefits humanity. The organization has several products – ChatGPT Free, ChatGPT Plus, and an enterprise offering, Enterprise ChatGPT.

**All three offerings maintain conversation history so long as it continues to fit within the token limit window.** At that point, the LLM does not use older portions of the conversation. OpenAI’s ChatGPT offerings are all based on training data as of September 2021, so more recent information is not available to the models by default. Plugins provide an awkward approach to incorporating more recent, though limited, information, but only via ChatGPT Plus and Enterprise ChatGPT.

**ChatGPT Free:** This service is for consumers who are just getting started with AI chatbots. It offers access to the GPT 3.5 model with a no-frills approach. The major advantage is that it’s free and great for experimentation. But, on the downside, access is based on the available capacity of the servers, which can be limited during peak business hours.

**ChatGPT Plus:** This offering is a significant step up from the free version. A full-featured, consumer-grade Chatbot allows users to choose between GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 models. That flexibility is helpful because GPT 3.5 is faster when you need an answer quickly, while GPT 4 is more accurate and can manage longer prompts and conversations for deeper dives.

In addition, ChatGPT Plus provides access to an ecosystem of plugins and advanced data analysis. You can even use personally developed (not public) plug-ins. At this level, you also gain access to Advanced Data Analysis, which will write and execute code in a sandbox. With advanced data analysis you can upload an Excel file, ask the chatbot to analyze it, and produce graphs for you. ChatGPT Plus is suited for individuals looking for a fully featured personal assistant but who do not have access to one via their enterprise.

**Enterprise ChatGPT:** [OpenAI gears its enterprise offering](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-enterprise) towards businesses that wish to leverage ChatGPT’s capabilities without the need to build their own. The enterprise service comes with every feature of the consumer-grade ChatGPT Plus, with added controls for access and authorization of services, additional data encryption, and an administrative dashboard to monitor the organization’s use.

Below is a quick comparison of OpenAI’s offerings\*:

[![ChatGPT vs Microsoft Bing AI Chatbot comparison](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart1_Comparison_092623-1024x484.png)](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart1_Comparison_092623.png)

## Microsoft Bing Chat

[Microsoft offers AI chat services](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/microsoft-copilot-an-executives-guide-to-getting-ready/) through Bing Chat and Bing Chat Enterprise, using an underlying technology provider in the form of a fine-tuned OpenAI GPT-4 model.

In April 2023, Microsoft secured a 49 percent stake in OpenAI via a $13 billion investment. With the investment came the partnership to allow Microsoft to run GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models on Microsoft infrastructure and offer services to their clients instead of requiring clients to be OpenAI customers. **Plainly stated, Bing Chat is isolated from OpenAI, but it uses a licensed version of OpenAI’s GPT models.**

Bing Chat is only available through Edge Browser, and users must sign in to a personal or corporate Microsoft account. The free and enterprise versions are virtually identical and include a creativity selection feature (Creative, Balanced, Precise) and extra functionality to generate insights on the current webpage. The ability to use Bing Chat to search the web and incorporate the current web page information is a defining difference between OpenAI’s offerings and Bing Chat’s offerings. Not only can Bing Chat do that, but it can also summarize public Microsoft Office documents open in a web browser.

While Bing Chat can incorporate more recent information, it does not have access to OpenAI’s plugin ecosystem, nor does it have advanced data analysis capabilities. You should view Bing Chat as exactly that — a Bing-driven search personal assistant. It can generate responses like OpenAI, but always in a more limited fashion. For example, it does not generate full-scale blog content in one pass.

Nevertheless, Bing Chat is a free service that’s a great medium for experimenting and gaining experience with GPT models, especially when integrating website content into search result insights.

**Bing Chat Enterprise:** The enterprise version of Bing Chat mirrors the free version, with an added layer of security. Notably, this version adheres to the Commercial Data Protection mandate, which ensures it doesn’t use the data, prompts and responses for model training. Also, while Bing Chat Enterprise can search and return Microsoft 365 documents, it cannot access those documents. Therefore, Bing Chat Enterprise cannot perform any actions based on their content.

**Copilot Implications:** A perennial question we get is about the impact of Copilot tools and Bing Chat Enterprise. As of September 2023, based on publicly available roadmap items, Copilot and Bing Chat Enterprise will not have any interaction with each other. Copilot tools focus on accelerating productivity and creativity within the application suite they serve.

[![ChatGPT vs Microsoft Bing AI Chatbot comparrison](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart2_Comparison_092623-1024x512.png)](https://centricconsulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/ChatGPT_Blog_Chart2_Comparison_092623.png)

## Build Your Own Chatbot

If your priorities include maximum flexibility and control, building your own AI chatbot using OpenAI’s API LLMs may be the best option. With a [build-your-own option](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-to-build-a-chatbot-people-want-to-use/), you must build your interface and security controls, but you can extend your chatbot with additional capabilities.

Fortunately, we have a baseline approach to building your chatbot to maximize flexibility, including the ability to use OpenAI’s plugin ecosystem. However, the consumption-based cost structure can make budgeting a challenge. **Still, for many organizations that want to [integrate ChatGPT](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/executives-top-14-chatgpt-faqs-an-ai-curated-resource/) into their existing applications or workflows, build-your-own is the only long-term viable option.**

One important note about OpenAI and Microsoft’s API endpoints: With OpenAI, you can access any model via a singular endpoint by passing in the model’s name, e.g., model=‘gpt-4’ or model=‘gpt-3.5-turbo-16k’. With Microsoft, your API endpoint only allows access to a singular deployed model. For example, if you use GPT-3.5 for fast responses and then switch to GPT-4 for more in-depth responses, you’ll need to code for two API endpoints with Microsoft, which corresponds to two different deployments.

Given the identical nature of the API and the underlying models, many aspects of comparison are identical between OpenAI and Microsoft.

## Our Recommendation

ChatGPT and Microsoft Bing come with unique capabilities, and the challenge lies in understanding the subtle, nuanced differences that may significantly impact their performance within specific use cases. As a result, it becomes exceedingly important to make a well-informed decision when choosing between these offerings. We recommend you carefully [consider your unique business needs](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-art-of-ai-adoption-how-operational-excellence-paves-the-way/), technical capabilities, and budget before committing to any of these options.

* * *

In our [previous blog](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-ai-and-chatgpt-are-fueling-creative-ideation-and-advancing-business-outcomes/), we explored how AI is enhancing human creativity by expanding our imaginative horizons. Building on that theme, we’ll now focus on another crucial aspect of the revolution: AI for productivity.

In this blog, we will discuss how AI enables professionals in the business world to work smarter, not harder, by enhancing productivity and efficiency. **By harnessing the power of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT, we can unleash our creative potential and optimize our workflows to achieve more with less effort.**

## Understanding Productivity in the Age of AI

As [AI continues to advance](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-rise-of-ai-in-the-workplace-chatgpts-role-in-shaping-the-future-of-work/), it is increasingly intertwining with efficiency. The intelligent algorithms behind AI tools enable them to learn from data, adapt to new situations and make informed decisions. This level of sophistication not only enhances the performance of individual tasks but also contributes to a more seamless and efficient workflow across the organization.

By embracing AI, professionals can leverage these powerful technologies to achieve more with less effort, unlocking new levels of productivity and setting the stage for innovation and growth in the business world.

## AI Tools and Technologies for Enhanced Productivity

When it comes to productivity, emphasize what people do best, deep work. **This complex work pushes professionals to their cognitive limits and is when people do some of their best, most impactful work.** By comparison, shallow work is unrewarding and tedious. For example, taking notes, documenting action items, and providing status updates are all things that make meetings dreadful.

When combined with our perpetual overbooking, we often miss out on important things and replace them with mundane activities we don’t enjoy. This leads to lower productivity and morale.

AI tools can potentially take over this surface-level, unfulfilling work to boost our individual and collective productivity. They complement human intelligence by automating mundane tasks, reducing errors and providing insights to help drive better decision making. Examples of these types of tools include:

Successful implementation and adoption of AI extend well beyond sophisticated technological capabilities. They demand an effective AI change management strategy that includes organizational change management (OCM,) enterprise portfolio and program management (PPM) and a strong emphasis on the human aspects of change.

This blog is the first in a series of posts focused on the intricacies, challenges and benefits of AI adoption. **It addresses why you need AI change management to achieve two strategic drivers of AI – cost control and growth.**

Future articles will address the various types of AI strategies organizations are adopting to ensure strategic alignment and operational effectiveness, the challenges and opportunities you may face when implementing AI, and ways you can use [AI to improve technology adoption](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/collaborative-intelligence-an-ai-powered-system-that-puts-humans-in-control/) and achieve [transformational change](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/4-key-ocm-considerations-before-implementing-change/).

But before diving into AI change management, let’s look briefly at just two benefits AI adoption offers: saving costs and enabling growth.

## Cost Savings and Growth Opportunities: Two Benefits of Artificial Intelligence

AI systems streamline operations and increase efficiency, leading to significant productivity, quality improvements and cost savings. Simultaneously, AI can drive growth by enabling your organization to offer innovative products, services and customer experiences.

When fully adopted, AI reduces the need for manual work and automates routine tasks, freeing employees to focus on more engaging, higher-value activities. **It not only lowers operational costs but also creates enriched job experiences and higher employee satisfaction.** At the same time, AI’s data analysis capabilities can identify inefficiencies, redundancies and bottlenecks, enabling organizations to optimize their processes, improve quality and further control costs.

AI also supports growth by helping organizations [understand their customers, markets and competition better](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/blog-series-achieving-customer-understanding-and-empathy/). This informs more effective business strategies and better-aligned business models. AI-powered analytics uncover hidden patterns, trends and insights in vast amounts of data, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions that enable growth. Furthermore, AI enables organizations to create personalized customer experiences, fostering customer loyalty and opening new revenue streams.

However, achieving any of these benefits requires the artful application of an [AI change management strategy](https://centricconsulting.com/technology-solutions/data-analytics/artificial-intelligence-ai-consulting/) that includes OCM and PPM.

## What to Do First

Your first step is determining your [AI vision, strategy and governance models](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/ai-adoption-how-to-navigate-and-establish-ai-governance-security-and-ethics/). You need these elements regardless of your chosen AI technology. The AI vision determines what level of AI adoption is possible and outlines the end-point destination for performance improvement and impact.

The strategy puts flesh on the bones of the vision with more detailed goals and timelines related to [people, process, technology and analytics](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/blog-series-working-better-together-for-stronger-solutions/). **The governance model establishes the policy and structure for AI tool usage, including ethical considerations, security, data privacy and compliance.**

In addition to the above, you should conduct a readiness assessment with AI experts and establish an AI center of excellence. A workforce and change plan will help you address the many people-related challenges AI adoption creates. This is where your organizational change management and portfolio and program management teams come into play.

A people-centric approach is critical to successful AI adoption. AI [change management programs](https://centricconsulting.com/business-consulting/people-and-change-consulting/organizational-change-management/), when effective, carefully consider the human dimensions of AI integration. These programs include reconfiguring job roles and the ethical implications and fostering an organizational culture that embraces change.

Inviting employees to actively participate in the AI implementation process can significantly demystify the technology, showcasing its role as a tool for enhancing their work rather than threatening job security. **This approach paves the way for heightened levels of employee engagement and acceptance of AI, the requirements of any successful business transformation.**

By its nature, AI brings about significant changes in how an organization operates that affect processes, job roles and even business models. If not managed properly, this level of change can disrupt your organization, resulting in AI adoption challenges such as resistance to change, low use rates and failure to realize the full benefits of AI.

### The Role of Leadership

Leadership plays a crucial role in supporting the adoption of AI-driven change. Leaders must champion change, demonstrate commitment and lead by example. The messaging leaders share is critical. They should use words like “augment” rather than “substitute” when communicating with employees.

**Exemplary leadership during [AI transformation](https://centricconsulting.com/resources/the-chatgpt-ai-revolution-an-executives-guide/) involves providing comprehensive resources and active support for the AI change management process.** This includes not only ensuring the right technical tools but also prioritizing developing necessary training and support structures. Building coalitions of support while creating and celebrating incremental wins helps leaders demonstrate their support.

### Managing Resistance to Change

Resistance to change is one of the biggest challenges organizations face during AI adoption. People often fear that AI will render their jobs obsolete or that they will not have the necessary skills to operate in an AI-driven environment. Applying OCM to an AI adoption framework can help address these fears by providing a clear vision of what the change entails, why it is necessary and how it will benefit the organization and its employees.

### Communication and Training

**Two key elements of OCM are communication and training.** Clear, consistent and transparent communication helps to manage expectations, alleviate fears and build trust. Communication involves explaining the reasons for AI adoption, its benefits and how it will impact different stakeholders. Leaders should encourage questions and feedback, creating an environment of trust and openness.

Training, on the other hand, equips employees with the necessary skills to operate in an [AI-driven environment](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/the-impact-of-ai-on-company-culture-and-how-to-prepare-now/). It helps to bridge the gap between current capabilities and those required in the future, reducing anxiety and resistance. Successful AI training programs champion a culture of continuous learning and development. They recognize that as AI evolves, so must the skills of the workforce. Hence, these programs often incorporate self-paced learning modules, mentorship opportunities and channels for feedback and improvement.

**By fostering an environment that encourages lifelong learning, organizations ensure their workforce remains agile and prepared for future technological advancements.**

Here’s an example of how General Electric used organizational change management to successfully adopt AI into their workflows.

#### _General Electric’s AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance_

General Electric (GE) [successfully adopted AI for predictive maintenance](https://www.technologyreview.com/2017/06/27/150784/general-electric-builds-an-ai-workforce/) in its aviation and energy businesses. The AI system analyzes machine data to predict potential failures, reducing maintenance costs and minimizing downtime.

GE’s approached its AI implementation with clear strategic alignment, strong project management and a focus on the people side of AI and change management. GE involved employees in the implementation process, equipped them with the necessary skills through training and maintained transparent communication throughout, effectively managing resistance and driving acceptance of the new technology.

## PPM: The Backbone of AI Change Management

Effective [portfolio and program management](https://centricconsulting.com/business-consulting/enterprise-portfolio-and-program-management/) plays a crucial role in successful AI adoption. It serves as the backbone that supports AI initiatives, ensuring alignment with business goals, efficient resource allocation and successful execution.

### Portfolio Management

In the context of AI adoption, portfolio management includes overseeing all AI-related initiatives within the organization to [ensure they align with the company’s strategic objectives](https://centricconsulting.com/client-stories/discovering-the-need-for-a-high-performing-pmo/). Effective portfolio management helps to prioritize AI initiatives based on their potential return on investment, feasibility and alignment with business goals. **It also enables organizations to balance their AI portfolio, ensuring a mix of short- and long-term initiatives and a balance between low- and high-risk projects.**

Moreover, portfolio management involves regularly reviewing the AI portfolio, assessing the performance of AI initiatives against predefined metrics and making necessary adjustments. By doing so, organizations can ensure their AI initiatives stay on track, deliver value and contribute to the strategic objectives.

### Program Management

While portfolio management provides a high-level view of all AI initiatives, program management focuses on coordinating related projects to achieve benefits companies could not obtain if they managed projects individually. In the context of AI adoption, program management is essential to ensure the successful delivery and execution of individual AI projects contributing to the overall AI strategy.

Effective program management involves defining clear roles and responsibilities, establishing robust governance structures or systems, and designing effective communication and reporting mechanisms. **It also involves coordinating efforts across different projects while managing interdependencies and complexities to mitigate risk.**

### PPM’s Role in Successful AI Adoption

By providing a structured approach to managing AI initiatives, portfolio and program management enable organizations to navigate the complexities of AI adoption effectively. The PPM team provides the necessary oversight, coordination and control to ensure the company efficiently executes the AI initiatives, delivers the expected benefits and contributes to the strategic objectives.

Moreover, PPM fosters a disciplined approach to AI adoption. The PPM team ensures your company pursues AI initiatives as part of a coherent, strategic approach to leveraging AI rather than in isolation. **This process helps to avoid wasted resources, misalignment and failure to realize AI’s potential benefits.**

Here’s an example of how JPMorgan used portfolio and project management during an AI implementation.

#### _JPMorgan Chase’s COiN_

JPMorgan Chase’s Contract Intelligence (COiN) platform is an [example of successful AI adoption](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/jpmorgan-marshals-an-army-of-developers-to-automate-high-finance?leadSource=uverify%20wall), underpinned by effective portfolio and program management. COiN uses machine learning to review legal documents and extract important data points and clauses, which would take thousands of hours if done manually.

The decision to develop COiN was part of JPMorgan’s broader portfolio of AI initiatives aimed at automating routine tasks and reducing operational costs. This strategic alignment ensured that COiN received the necessary resources and support from the top management.

Program management was vital during the development and implementation of COiN. Given the complexity of the project and the need to integrate with existing systems, they required rigorous planning, organization and risk management. **The program management team ensured that the company effectively coordinated and executed different aspects of the project, from data collection and model training to system integration and user training.**

## Conclusion

AI offers organizations a powerful tool to control costs and drive growth simultaneously. However, to fully realize these benefits, organizations must take a people-centric approach to build their AI adoption framework and leverage strategic portfolio and program management processes.

By doing so, organizations will ensure their AI initiatives deliver maximum value and drive long-term, sustainable success. In the next post of this series, we’ll discuss how business architecture, business process improvement and performance measurement contribute to successful AI implementation.

Every business will be impacted by AI and will have AI incorporated throughout its operations. Your company’s culture will impact how quickly and successfully an organization can adopt AI. And, done well, AI can actually improve company culture.

## How Can AI Boost Company Culture?

An [MIT working paper](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/inline-files/Noy_Zhang_1.pdf) showed [ChatGPT raised productivity](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-ai-and-chatgpt-are-fueling-creative-ideation-and-advancing-business-outcomes/), decreased inequality between workers by helping employees with fewer specialized skills, and enhanced job satisfaction and self-efficacy. It also brought about both concern and excitement related to the use of AI technologies.

Among MIT survey respondents who implemented AI and saw improved efficiency and decision making, “75 percent also saw improvements in team morale, collaboration and collective learning,” it said. “Culture change from using AI transcends the legitimate, but myopic, promise that AI will liberate workers from drudgery.”

**AI’s high level of refinement means it can enhance the performance of individuals and teams, streamline workflows, and even complete some tasks that enable employees to focus on more meaningful work.**

Once mundane careers can now be exciting, as employees can work more efficiently and branch into other areas they may have never had the opportunity to explore. As this becomes the reality at an organization, employees can feel empowered to perform work that increases business value with creative and innovative solutions.

Recently, Erik Brynjolfsson, an economist based at Stanford University, and MIT economists Danielle Li and Lindsey R. Raymond [published a working paper](https://www.nber.org/papers/w31161), “Generative AI at Work,” that showed the effects of AI on a software company that implemented it to aid in its customer service responses.

Among its findings were that access to the tool increased employee productivity by an average of 14 percent and that customers and employees were happier. On the customer side, customer ratings of support staff increased, and customers were less likely to elevate the request to a supervisor. On the company side, new-hire turnover decreased, and lower-skilled employees with fewer specialized skills saw a jump in their performance. **This improvement can be, at least partially, credited to the AI tool using successful conversations to create answers for other questions.**

“It used to be that high-skilled workers would come up with a good answer, and that would only help them and their customer,” [Brynjolfsson told NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2023/05/02/1172791281/this-company-adopted-ai-heres-what-happened-to-its-human-workers). “Now that good answer gets amplified and used by people throughout the organization.”

## Determining Your Culture’s Readiness for AI

“Business culture affects AI deployments, and AI deployments affect business culture,” the MIT Sloan Management Review’s [Big Ideas Research Report said](https://sloanreview.mit.edu/projects/the-cultural-benefits-of-artificial-intelligence-in-the-enterprise/). To realize these benefits, though, leaders must build a culture that supports AI implementation and the changes that come along with any new innovation.

**Every company will have its own cultural nuances in implementing a controversial and somewhat unpredictable technology.** Everything from the nature of work for an organization to employee demographics and the IT security infrastructure in place will play a role in how AI is perceived, deployed and used at an organization.

When considering what types of AI to implement and how to deploy them at your organization, one of your primary considerations should be a readiness for change throughout the company.

Questions for leadership include:

- **How have previous changes been received?** Start by reviewing previous changes within your company. What cultural issues came up, and how were they addressed by leadership? Was the initiative ultimately a success, or what led to its failure?
- **What is the level of interest in innovation within your company?** Do employees show enthusiasm for new ideas, and are they willing to take measured risks?
- **How do you want your organization to use AI, and have you communicated it to all employees?** Creating an approach and policy to AI helps remove doubt about using it as a tool and sets standards and best practices that are consistent with your organization’s culture.
- **What is the trust level of your organization?** Trust is a huge component of implementing change successfully, and it goes both ways. Do leaders trust their employees to take measured risks and to comply with stated policies? Do employees believe leaders are honest and have their best interests in mind? Are leaders modeling transparency?

Building a culture of trust doesn’t start when you’re implementing change. If you have a [culture that isn’t innovative](https://centricconsulting.com/careers-resources/how-we-created-an-award-winning-innovation-culture-and-you-can-too/), leaders who don’t train employees properly on new tools and technologies or who aren’t transparent about the risks and opportunities of new innovations, any investment in AI will fail.

Research has shown that 70 percent of [digital transformations](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/without-the-right-culture-your-digital-transformation-efforts-will-fail/) fail, and [one study](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/increasing-odds-of-success-in-digital-transformation) shows the determining factor isn’t technology, but people. “The technology is important, but the people dimension (organization, operating model, processes and culture) is usually the determining factor. Organizational inertia from deeply rooted behaviors is a big impediment.”

**Consistency, transparency, empowerment and enablement are key, and it begins with education and understanding.** When you have effective change management — clear and timely communications, targeted learning opportunities, and meaningful ways to share feedback and concerns — the introduction of innovations such as AI can be less intimidating and disruptive to the operations of an organization.

## Help Employees Understand AI is Augmentation, Not Substitution

Leaders need to start preparing their workforce to see AI tools as augmentation rather than substitution. Whether people realize it or not, AI is already a part of our daily lives, from smartphones and smart cars to aspects of social media, spell check and even performing a Google search.

Suddenly, a task that was a challenge before can be done quickly and efficiently with the help of AI. **Leaders need to show enthusiasm about equipping and educating teams on the potential uses of AI, helping their employees learn why their roles are important and how they can deliver more value with AI as a tool.**

Often, when people are reluctant to change, it’s not that they’re afraid of technology but what it could mean for their role. With AI and ChatGPT, the primary fear is that AI will replace them by fully automating their position, or at least enough of their role that they won’t be needed.

What people sometimes don’t realize is that as tasks are automated, new opportunities present themselves. When they’re free from time-consuming or menial tasks like notetaking, approving expense reports, or looking for a piece of information, productivity and creativity can soar. Employees find they have time to do deeper, more meaningful or strategic work.

The introduction and [adaptation to AI will require upskilling](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/how-to-build-and-empower-an-ai-ready-workforce-with-reskilling-and-upskilling/) and, in some cases, reskilling. In other instances, AI will simply lessen the load for employees who tend to become overworked, such as those in high-turnover roles. AI can provide much-needed breathing room and help employees embrace the idea of change. **To be effective, leaders will need to develop training programs and learning paths for employees to thrive, as well as get buy-in from their teams.**

As leaders, it’s our responsibility to create a culture that’s excited about — rather than fearful of — changes with the potential to improve everyone’s work experience. To cross the bridge from skepticism to excitement and help accelerate the adoption of AI in their company, leaders should assess their company’s readiness for change and the gap they have to overcome for what is certain to be on the horizon.

The past few years brought about a seismic shift in the modern workplace, altering how we work and communicate in ways we never imagined possible. Amidst this upheaval, ChatGPT’s meteoric ascent has captured the public’s imagination, spurring conversations about the potential of AI to impact the future of work.

Through this blog series, we will dive deeper to explore the myriad ways in which ChatGPT and other AI technologies are transforming the modern workplace. **From the rise of remote work and the gig economy to the potential implications for job displacement and reskilling, we will examine the complex and ever-evolving landscape of work in the 21st century.**

Get ready to explore the brave new world of using AI in the workplace with us.

## What is ChatGPT?

ChatGPT is an advanced large language model (LLM) based on the generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) architecture OpenAI developed. As a language model, ChatGPT can understand and generate human-like language, allowing it to perform tasks such as language translation, text summarization and content generation. With its advanced natural language processing capabilities, ChatGPT can analyze large volumes of data, extract insights and provide accurate predictions.

ChatGPT is one of many AI models in the marketplace, but it is the most viral one thus far, fueled by both [Microsoft’s multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-announces-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-chatgpt-maker-openai.html) and the capabilities it has [exhibited](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2023/03/01/the-best-examples-of-what-you-can-do-with-chatgpt/?sh=69b4c478df11) to date.

Given ChatGPT’s advanced natural language processing capabilities, it has a significant impact on the workplace, from improving customer service to generating content and assisting with data analysis and decision making.

## Bursting With Impact: How ChatGPT Transforms the Workplace Landscape

The ramifications of ChatGPT on the professional sphere are poised to be momentous and far-reaching. Already making waves in [various workplace applications](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/generate-agile-acceptance-criteria-with-chatgpt-to-supercharge-story-creation/), ChatGPT has become a catalyst for automation, content generation and [data analysis assistance](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/navigating-success-in-the-new-wild-west-of-data-governance-strategy/).

Microsoft’s strategic investment and rapid deployment of OpenAI’s prowess only serve to hasten this remarkable transformation. **This cutting-edge AI is set to revolutionize work and enhance human capabilities in three primary ways: igniting creativity, propelling productivity and elevating skills.**

### Unleashing the Creative Spirit

In the realm of creativity, next-generation AI opens the door to countless inventive and expressive possibilities. No longer confined to the daunting emptiness of a blank page, we can now collaborate with AI to generate a plethora of options – from speech ideas and white paper drafts to multiple renditions of customer presentations.

This innovation does not render AI as a replacement for human ingenuity. Rather, it supplements and enriches our abilities, fostering an entirely novel mode of operation.

### Unlocking the Potential for Productivity

To genuinely concentrate on the most critical tasks, we must first grapple with the pervasive issue of information overload, a challenge the era of [hybrid work only intensified](https://centricconsulting.com/blog/4-signs-your-hybrid-strategy-isnt-working/). AI in the workplace emerges as a potent ally in this struggle.

**The crux of the information overload dilemma lies in determining relevance.** Amidst the deluge of data and information, only a minuscule fraction is pertinent to an individual’s needs or tasks. We can unearth vital nuggets of information, hidden within vast data mountains, with AI’s assistance. AI can help us summarize meeting notes, convert white papers into presentations, or draft responsive emails focusing on the salient points.

[GitHub’s research](https://github.blog/2022-09-07-research-quantifying-github-copilots-impact-on-developer-productivity-and-happiness/) points to the promise of next-generation AI to unlock productivity. In a survey of developers, 88 percent said they were able to get tasks done more quickly using AI-powered GitHub Copilot than without it, and 74 percent said it enabled them to focus on more satisfying work.

### Elevating Skills and Expertise

The notion of augmentation versus substitution is pivotal for grasping the capabilities of next-generation AI. If an individual excels in a particular area, AI can help them soar to even greater heights. If they were previously unable to perform a task, AI empowers them to accomplish it. **As AI lifts the constraints that once hindered our ideas from materializing, work becomes a more fulfilling and joyful experience.**

## Transitioning to the Future: A Glimpse into the Blog Series Ahead

AI is important because of its potential to transform the way organizations operate and serve their customers. **The potential long-term impact of AI on the global economy is significant.** By enabling organizations to become more competitive and innovative, AI will help drive economic growth and create new fields, new opportunities and new jobs. It will also help organizations become more sustainable by enabling them to operate more efficiently and reduce their environmental impact.

As we dive deeper into the transformative power of AI and its implications for the workplace, this blog series will explore numerous facets of AI-driven innovation.

Stay tuned as we examine real-world applications, discuss ethical considerations, and share insights on how organizations can harness the potential of AI to reshape the professional landscape and foster a thriving workforce in parts two to five of this series.
