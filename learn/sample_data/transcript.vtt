<v Jen Barnes>Check it out.</v>

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:25.110
<v Mike Bigenwald>So you say no kittens harmed in the filming of this?</v>

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.190
<v Larry English>Exactly.</v>

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:28.490
<v Jen Barnes>Umm.</v>

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Larry English>The with the SA group.</v>

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.210
<v Larry English>Uh.</v>

00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:40.750
<v Jen Barnes>It's.</v>

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:45.130
<v Larry English>Week or so ago, and there's a a game that my family plays and it's called, I think it's poet.</v>

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Larry English>Is it Neanderthal poetry?</v>

00:07:50.010 --> 00:07:50.460
<v CentricEvents>The good one?</v>

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.730
<v Larry English>And you have you can only.</v>

00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:51.660
<v Larry English>What is it?</v>

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:53.430
<v CentricEvents>I said that's a good one.</v>

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:54.910
<v Larry English>Super good.</v>

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:59.970
<v Larry English>Super fun, but you you can only give clues in one word syllables.</v>

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:08.230
<v Larry English>And if you say a word that has more than one syllable, the person next to you has a blow up club and they hit you over the head.</v>

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.860
<v Larry English>So it's super fun.</v>

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.610
<v Mark Federman>I played a I played a game over the weekend.</v>

00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:21.680
<v Larry English>Ooh.</v>

00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:31.120
<v Mark Federman>It was you put on these goggles that made everything upside down and then you draw a card and the card says like, you've gotta write like your name or like, draw a house and you got like seconds to play.</v>

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.360
<v Mark Federman>So it's like everybody takes a turn.</v>

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:34.520
<v Mark Federman>Obviously you put the goggles on.</v>

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Mark Federman>You're like, alright, go.</v>

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:51.240
<v Mark Federman>And it's like you've got 10 seconds to this or 30 seconds to this and I got to tell you, it was probably one of the most hilarious things because you're watching the person because they got these frigging ridiculous goggles on and then they're trying to draw like a, like a triangle.</v>

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:56.950
<v Mark Federman>And it's upside down and we figured out that one of the people at the table had been a teacher.</v>

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Mark Federman>So you know how teachers can do things upside down quite easily?</v>

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.770
<v Mark Federman>So she was, like, phenomenal at the game.</v>

00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.600
<v Mark Federman>And we're like, what the heck is going on?</v>

00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Mark Federman>And never the rest of us are like trying to draw triangle.</v>

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:09.950
<v Mark Federman>It looks like a, you know, it doesn't look like anything.</v>

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:11.540
<v Mark Federman>So it's a really, it's a really fun game.</v>

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.040
<v Jen Barnes>What's it called, Mark?</v>

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:15.150
<v Mark Federman>I knew you were gonna ask me that.</v>

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:18.530
<v Mark Federman>I put his probably said that in the beginning if I knew, but I'll I'll find out, I'll get.</v>

00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Jen Barnes>OK, we could probably Google it.</v>

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:23.020
<v Mark Federman>I'll get the name of it and send it to you, but it's it's a lot of fun to play with not only adults, but kids too.</v>

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.440
<v Mark Federman>And it's it's quite fun.</v>

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.460
<v Jen Barnes>That sounds fun.</v>

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.040
<v Darren Rehrer>Well, I'll just say that there's a famous one called.</v>

00:09:31.050 --> 00:09:32.150
<v Darren Rehrer>Who's the dude?</v>

00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:35.450
<v Darren Rehrer>And it's a charades game with a blow up doll.</v>

00:09:35.510 --> 00:09:39.870
<v Darren Rehrer>That's so it's like a life size blow up doll that you're supposed to act out.</v>

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:40.190
<v Darren Rehrer>Whatever.</v>

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.890
<v Darren Rehrer>You're charade card is with the doll.</v>

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.180
<v Darren Rehrer>You can make that as.</v>

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Darren Rehrer>G or all the way up the rating scale was you want based on those scales.</v>

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:52.570
<v Darren Rehrer>That's all I'm gonna say no.</v>

00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Mark Federman>The as the family.</v>

00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:56.430
<v Mark Federman>Family, family, friendly down and family friendly.</v>

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:57.370

<v Maurice Faison>So if we could love CMD everybody on the screen, but if you're not a presenter, you can go ahead and turn your cameras off.</v>

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Maurice Faison>Everyone makes sure that you're on mute, and we're gonna kick things off with some centric good news stories.</v>

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.160
<v Maurice Faison>And so first up, I'm gonna.</v>

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Maurice Faison>Oh, there he is.</v>

00:12:16.730 --> 00:12:17.460
<v Maurice Faison>Noah Grayson.</v>

00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:25.410
<v Maurice Faison>Noah Grayson from our Indianapolis operating group is going to share a bit about what happened recently in India, no.</v>

00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Noah Grayson>Yeah. The hey.</v>

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.100
<v Noah Grayson>Thanks, Maurice.</v>

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:28.890
<v Noah Grayson>Appreciate it.</v>

00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Noah Grayson>So I've got a good news story to share with you, and this one comes from a long tenured centric client AES.</v>

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:48.400
<v Noah Grayson>Formerly known as Date and Power and Light in Indianapolis, Power and Light prior to the acquisition of AES, but we've had a really long relationship, a really consistent.</v>

00:12:50.290 --> 00:12:58.210
<v Noah Grayson>High value delivery engagements over a number of years and that's earned us a ton of trust with this client.</v>

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:03.200
<v Noah Grayson>And I know a number of people on this call have probably had some exposure to AES over the years.</v>

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:24.120
<v Noah Grayson>Umm, but despite some efforts by Accenture and KPMG, who have presented AES Alternative Solutions, ages is turned to centric that to help them integrate with SAP and enhance a field service management application.</v>

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:27.940
<v Noah Grayson>So we're excited to embark on this journey with them.</v>

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:34.250
<v Noah Grayson>Phase one of this effort is valued at roughly $850,000.</v>

00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:47.800
<v Noah Grayson>We think this project will have a long runway for us though, as as more enhancements and expansion of the application takes takes place in the coming years.</v>

00:13:49.820 --> 00:14:15.690
<v Noah Grayson>There have been a lot of people involved from the beginning and the pursuit of this opportunity, but there's been a core group of people that have been engaged since the inception of this and I'd like to do just a handful of shout outs and extend my personal appreciation for the efforts of Pam Berry, Scott Paulman, Scott Stover and Steve Sisco.</v>

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:24.180
<v Noah Grayson>They've worked extremely hard on this opportunity and have been incredibly creative in developing our solution and approach.</v>

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:29.450
<v Noah Grayson>So well done by all, and in particular that that core team.</v>

00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:30.780
<v Larry English>No.</v>

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:31.110
<v Maurice Faison>Cool.</v>

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:32.820
<v Larry English>Do you know if any of my cobalt code is still running?</v>

00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:37.130
<v Noah Grayson>It's it is still there, but we're going to shut that down here pretty soon.</v>

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:41.370
<v Maurice Faison>Great. Great.</v>

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:41.370
<v Larry English>I didn't.</v>

00:14:45.210 --> 00:14:46.740
<v Matt Haunz>I I do. I do.</v>

00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:48.170
<v Maurice Faison>About.</v>

00:14:46.790 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Matt Haunz>Yes, it's impressive.</v>

00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:48.710
<v Matt Haunz>Stuff.</v>

00:14:49.670 --> 00:14:50.890
<v Matt Haunz>It will ask to go I'm sure.</v>

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:52.280
<v Maurice Faison>Yeah.</v>

00:14:52.350 --> 00:14:55.370
<v Maurice Faison>So anyone that that that's freaked out by AI?</v>

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.650
<v Jim Schaller>For the record, Jim, Jim Schaller Jim Schaller has cobalt code.</v>

00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:58.500
<v Jim Schaller>Jim Schaller has cobalt code too out there.</v>

00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:01.550
<v Maurice Faison>Yeah, cool.</v>

00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:02.470
<v Jim Schaller>Hanging out for the record.</v>

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.890
<v Maurice Faison>Hey, thanks, Noah.</v>

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:07.650
<v Maurice Faison>Appreciate that for those I don't know AES state and power and light was client number one.</v>

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:14.420
<v Maurice Faison>So that's an account that's near and dear, you know, to our hearts and and to see that we are continuing to work there.</v>

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.290
<v Maurice Faison>It is great.</v>

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:15.930
<v Maurice Faison>Great to hear.</v>

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:17.880
<v Maurice Faison>So thanks again, Noah.</v>

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.870
<v Maurice Faison>Next up, Kent Hansen from operational excellence practice.</v>

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.180
<v Maurice Faison>Give us an update on secura and insurance team there.</v>

00:15:26.660 --> 00:15:27.530
<v Kent Hansen>Alright, thanks a lot.</v>

00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:32.100
<v Kent Hansen>It's great to hear about the the success we've been having on AES from Noah.</v>

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:32.980
<v Kent Hansen>Thank you, Noah.</v>

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:35.490
<v Kent Hansen>So secure is a great story.</v>

00:15:35.500 --> 00:16:08.000
<v Kent Hansen>We've had a long standing relationship with our DNA team setting up the platform there and Jeremy Gruenwald of our Chicago office has played a major role there and it has a great relationship with the client and he heard about an RPA need at secura and plugged in our team, me and Nick, Ron and we were able to work together with the client and they were very interested in it and it started becoming also more than an RPA needed, but also a more general power platform need.</v>

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:12.320
<v Kent Hansen>And so we plugged in Carrie Butler and her team and we were working collectively on it.</v>

00:16:12.330 --> 00:16:21.250
<v Kent Hansen>And our main sponsor was very excited to do work with us, but we had a major roadblock from the client's Infosec team.</v>

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:49.050
<v Kent Hansen>They were butting heads with our project sponsor on whether this project would be valuable or the timing was is right, especially with a lot of the focus around governance for the project and last minute they asked us to join this meeting between the Infosec team and our project sponsors team, which we didn't have a lot of time to prepare for and we threw together A-Team to to manage this.</v>

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Kent Hansen>This kind of client enter fighting which which was tough and we only had half an hour and so let me set the stage a little bit for this client meeting.</v>

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:18.410
<v Kent Hansen>There was probably 5 people from each side of on the client side, so about 10 people, five from the Infosec team, five from our project sponsors team and and so so 10 clients in this 30 minute meeting that we were supposed to resolve all the issues in was was a daunting task.</v>

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:25.300
<v Kent Hansen>We asked Jeremy Young from the OE team who has a lot of RPA credentials.</v>

00:17:25.310 --> 00:17:34.040
<v Kent Hansen>He's a senior architect from our team to to really learn about the entire problem and be able to resolve it.</v>

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.000
<v Kent Hansen>And it was a tough task.</v>

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:51.780
<v Kent Hansen>The Jeremy came in, learned about the program very the the problem that they were butting heads around described very calmly how the technology works and how you could put governance around it and why it's important to put governance around it.</v>

00:17:51.870 --> 00:18:00.950
<v Kent Hansen>By the end of this half an hour meeting, we had everybody, both sides of the client teams nodding their heads full approval.</v>

00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:01.690
<v Kent Hansen>Let's do this.</v>

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:08.360
<v Kent Hansen>We understand the need for it and we got the the the SOW signed shortly thereafter.</v>

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Kent Hansen>So it was a.</v>

00:18:09.490 --> 00:18:21.940
<v Kent Hansen>It was a great instance of the team coming together, demonstrating our qualifications in a short manner, a working very well with the client team effort and now we're executing this week on it.</v>

00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:31.720
<v Maurice Faison>Outstanding out and you know always love it when we see BCS and Tech SL coming together, you know, solve our our clients toughest problems.</v>

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:32.900
<v Maurice Faison>So thanks.</v>

00:18:33.130 --> 00:18:35.300
<v Maurice Faison>Thanks for sharing that Ken.</v>

00:18:35.310 --> 00:18:36.740
<v Maurice Faison>Love kicking off meetings like that.</v>

00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:55.210
<v Maurice Faison>And so let's keep with this celebratory mood and bring up the fact that this is 25 years in business for centric consulting major milestone, if you remember in January, Misty told us about some of the ways that we're going to be celebrating this anniversary externally.</v>

00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:02.010
<v Maurice Faison>Jen is here today to talk about some of the ways that we'll be celebrating this this milestone internally.</v>

00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.660
<v Maurice Faison>So turning over you, Jim.</v>

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.310
<v Jen Barnes>All right.</v>

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.530
<v Jen Barnes>Hello everyone.</v>

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.310
<v Jen Barnes>Yeah.</v>

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Jen Barnes>So we are super excited to launch our internal celebration of our 25th anniversary.</v>

00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:25.970
<v Jen Barnes>There are a number of ways that everybody here can join in on the celebration throughout the year, especially in the next six months, and then this will culminate at the September meeting later this year.</v>

00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:32.450
<v Jen Barnes>So first of all I have to give a special shout out to Julie Shaffer, who is the mastermind behind all of this.</v>

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:39.700
<v Jen Barnes>Just huge thanks and kudos to Julie for driving this and continuing to make this happen throughout the year.</v>

00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:40.580
<v Jen Barnes>It's going to be great.</v>

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:49.460
<v Jen Barnes>So the first thing you need to know is that the Centric 25 channel just launched a few moments ago on the All centric team.</v>

00:19:49.470 --> 00:19:56.320
<v Jen Barnes>This is really going to be the hub over the next six months for all of the activity and sharing and that sort of thing.</v>

00:19:56.370 --> 00:20:03.430
<v Jen Barnes>So make sure that you check that out frequently, so there's going to be a few ways to engage over the next six months or so.</v>

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:06.790
<v Jen Barnes>So first tune into this channel every week.</v>

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:22.470
<v Jen Barnes>You're gonna be able to see kind of throwbacks to centric history as well as flash forwards to where we're headed in the future and kind of people's ponderings on the next 25 and what they want to see.</v>

00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:34.790
<v Jen Barnes>We're also going to share occasional updates about the work that marketing is doing and how we can externally promote our 25th anniversary and how you can help share that news.</v>

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:42.100
<v Jen Barnes>And then third, starting next week, you should be looking for posts about our Centric 25 challenge game.</v>

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.020
<v Jen Barnes>So what is the Centric 25 challenge game?</v>

<v Jen Barnes>So Julie's gonna be posting some fold game details along with the first challenge on the centric 25 challenge on Monday.</v>

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:29.200
<v Jen Barnes>So please stay tuned and check that out so to kick us off, we wanted to share kind of a celebratory highlight reel that was put together by Julie Shaffer and that looks back on some of the moments that have helped lay the foundation for our culture today.</v>

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:32.400
<v Jen Barnes>But on that note, I wanted to mention.</v>

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:42.840
<v Jen Barnes>So this year, I kind of said this earlier this year, celebration is all about or is not all about just thinking about the past and celebrating the past.</v>

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:49.700
<v Jen Barnes>That's definitely a component, you know, memories and shared experiences are kind of an important part of a living culture.</v>

00:21:50.010 --> 00:21:55.730
<v Jen Barnes>But celebrating our 25th is equally about where we're headed about our dreams for the future.</v>

00:21:55.820 --> 00:22:02.760
<v Jen Barnes>Our memories that we have yet to make and about the things that are going to be important to us as we continue to evolve together as a company.</v>

00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:06.420
<v Jen Barnes>So we want to spend this year collecting and sharing all of these thoughts.</v>

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:07.580
<v Jen Barnes>Umm.</v>

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.200
<v Jen Barnes>With that, let's take a look at our video.</v>

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.870
<v Jen Barnes>So as we learned yesterday, the hard way this may automatically start for you.</v>

00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.910
<v Jen Barnes>If it doesn't, you may have to hit the play button on your screen and then sync to presenter.</v>

00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:25.310
<v Jen Barnes>So Abby's gonna kick this off right now.</v>

00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:30.550
<v Jen Barnes>If it doesn't start immediately, click the little button in the screen and you should be good to go.</v>

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.310
<v Jen Barnes>All right, thanks.</v>

00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.720
<v Maurice Faison>Wow, that was.</v>

00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.630

00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.020
<v Maurice Faison>So thanks, whoever Marketing put that together.</v>

<v Maurice Faison>Umm yeah, I didn't get a preview of that one.</v>

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:21.150
<v Jen Barnes>Julie Shaffer.</v>

00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.850
<v Maurice Faison>That was a great.</v>

00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:24.460

<v Maurice Faison>You know, having been here myself, you know the past 20 something years, you know, seeing so many familiar faces was was great, but even more so.</v>

00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:53.950
<v Maurice Faison>I loved seeing so many newer faces, so many different faces, and so that that encapsulated just a glimpse into our growth and and a little snapshot of what the future holds for us.</v>

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:58.500
<v Maurice Faison>So that was, uh, that was special and I can't wait for that to be posted, you know?</v>

00:26:58.510 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Maurice Faison>So we can rewatch that back if you have a particularly tough day.</v>

00:27:02.470 --> 00:27:05.110
<v Maurice Faison>So again, thanks to Julie and team for that.</v>

00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:13.300
<v Maurice Faison>OK, let's shift gears and let's talk about our leadership team structure.</v>

00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:23.900
<v Maurice Faison>So back in January and I'm looking at Larry here, you you talked about the new leadership team structure and so now we are a couple of months into that structure.</v>

00:27:24.510 --> 00:27:27.520
<v Maurice Faison>Let's dive a little bit deeper into into this model if you would.</v>

00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:29.020
<v Larry English>Sure.</v>

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:35.540
<v Larry English>I I don't know who did this, but putting me after the video to talk about org structure not cool, but I'm going.</v>

00:27:35.610 --> 00:27:38.040
<v Larry English>I'm gonna make this so amazingly exciting.</v>

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:44.100
<v Larry English>You will be on the edge of your seat, so let me back up a tiny bit for everybody.</v>

00:27:44.110 --> 00:28:01.720
<v Larry English>So about, let's say the beginning of 2023, we put in place a new org structure and the reason we did that is we outgrew our old one and we need to put something new in place to support growing significantly.</v>

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:19.700
<v Larry English>We wanted to make sure we had broad perspectives in our decision making and then we also had to really be cognizant of succession planning because we are going to have many people start to retire and we needed an organization structure that would support, you know, grooming people and getting people ready and.</v>

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:22.260
<v Larry English>And so we had to put that in place.</v>

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:29.680
<v Larry English>So we operated that way for about a year and we did a checkpoint at the end of last year and we said, hey, what's working well?</v>

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:30.360
<v Larry English>What isn't?</v>

00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:37.570
<v Larry English>And there was one thing that was definitely not working well, and that was the EDC had two they're trying to do too much, too much on their plate.</v>

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.610
<v Larry English>And so we took a checkpoint.</v>

00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:53.770
<v Larry English>We did a facilitated session with a senior leadership team and we iterated on that original model and the result is what you're going to see that I'm going to go over right now if you guys can go to that next page.</v>

00:28:53.780 --> 00:29:00.590
<v Larry English>And so we put this org structure new org structure in place the beginning of 2024.</v>

00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:03.070
<v Larry English>I'm happy to say I think it's working really well.</v>

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.600
<v Larry English>I think that so far the indications are the tweaks that we made were the right ones.</v>

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:23.090
<v Larry English>I would say this is a more traditional org structure that you would see in in many companies, which is what people are asking for, and then the other thing is that clearly defines accountability across all of our functions.</v>

00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.790
<v Larry English>There's actually a very there's a 300 line racy that supports this.</v>

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.410
<v Larry English>The the stuff that I'm going to go through.</v>

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.350
<v Larry English>Thank you to Verna for doing that.</v>

00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.690
<v Larry English>And I think we'll have that published as well.</v>

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:40.310
<v Larry English>So we are growing up and we've put in place a really great org structure to help us scale for the future.</v>

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:45.930
<v Larry English>So as as Maurice mentioned, you saw this at the town January town hall, I believe.</v>

00:29:46.170 --> 00:30:05.090
<v Larry English>And what I'm going to do is actually go into each row and a little bit more detail so everybody understands each of the functions O I'm going to start on that first line, that first row and you see the ECU in the upper left hand corner and kind of think of that as the board now.</v>

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:09.170
<v Larry English>So this is the group that's supposed to make enterprise wide decisions.</v>

00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:23.660
<v Larry English>An example of that might be like the decision to open a new office or something, you know, really big impactful to the organization, but the rest of the decision making decision making is pushed down to closest.</v>

00:30:23.670 --> 00:30:27.540
<v Larry English>You know, we want to get it closest to the leaders that are running that business.</v>

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:32.100
<v Larry English>This group is meant to meet, you know, fairly infrequently, like a board would.</v>

00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:35.760
<v Larry English>So I think we've met once so far this year as an example.</v>

00:30:35.770 --> 00:30:44.080
<v Larry English>So it's either going to be monthly, quarterly, something like that, and then the other thing I want to point out is everybody that's in that box has a day job.</v>

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:47.450
<v Larry English>So they're just not hanging out waiting for that next meeting.</v>

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:58.120
<v Larry English>And then you can see the CEO and then you can see a traditional Corp development box, which is where you would expect strategy and Acquisition development to occur.</v>

00:30:58.230 --> 00:31:03.720
<v Larry English>So that's that first row and then I'm going to go to the next slide, the next row.</v>

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:07.300
<v Larry English>Please pretty please.</v>

00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:10.700
<v Larry English>OK, so this is the operations committee.</v>

00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:14.190
<v Larry English>This is all about day to day execution of the company.</v>

00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:28.890
<v Larry English>It's this is the kind of the major tweak that that we made, and this group has meant to have broad representation about across all the key functions that we need to operate the business.</v>

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.390
<v Larry English>So whenever we're making a decision, we have all of the key inputs that we need to do to make the right decision.</v>

00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:36.090
<v Larry English>And this is all about Operations.</v>

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:44.930
<v Larry English>So an example of a decision this group might do or function is we recently did an analysis of our 2023 profitability and we said what do we have to do differently?</v>

00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.430
<v Larry English>And here's the actions we're going to take.</v>

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.760
<v Larry English>That group would undertake that and you can see by the bullet points under each of the boxes.</v>

00:31:53.290 --> 00:31:53.870
<v Larry English>Accountability.</v>

00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:06.590
<v Larry English>Uh, you can see the functions that each of those groups have and and it's a very traditional accountabilities divided across people, operations, sales and so forth.</v>

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:16.150
<v Larry English>You can see all of that, and it's all about each person that's in that box is responsible for driving the results in those functional areas and has accountability for that.</v>

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:22.710
<v Larry English>This group meets twice a week and the topics are very operational alright.</v>

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.550
<v Larry English>I'm going to go to the next box because you guys are.</v>

00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.250
<v Larry English>You guys are still awake and listen to me.</v>

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:31.510
<v Larry English>So the the next box is the senior leadership team.</v>

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.880
<v Larry English>This we introduced several years ago and it's worked really well.</v>

00:32:36.890 --> 00:32:45.570
<v Larry English>This group is about providing guidance and advice to the operating committee on any kind of major decision before we make it.</v>

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:50.650
<v Larry English>We're getting input from this group and again it we want to make sure we're hearing everybody's voice.</v>

00:32:50.820 --> 00:33:03.120
<v Larry English>So we make really good decisions and so we'll take major decisions to this group and we'll say, hey, there's three things to think about before this meeting and we want your input and we want to hear from everybody.</v>

00:33:03.370 --> 00:33:14.940
<v Larry English>And so this group is not a decision making body, but it it's providing thoughtful debate, feedback, advice, problem solving so that we can take it and then make a decision.</v>

00:33:15.410 --> 00:33:20.450
<v Larry English>The other thing I want to point out is we added NVP's to this and and people like what is an MVP.</v>

00:33:21.350 --> 00:33:28.660
<v Larry English>We've had that role for a very long time, but essentially what it is is provide oversight and guidance for all of our OG's.</v>

00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:39.460
<v Larry English>Every single OG has an MVP and it is when you get to our size you need an efficient way to get information out share feedback so that we can act faster as an organization.</v>

00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:47.370
<v Larry English>And so that's the role of an MVP and that has worked very well for us, alright.</v>

00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:53.210
<v Larry English>And then I'm going to get to the last box, which is the extended leadership team.</v>

00:33:53.220 --> 00:33:53.820
<v Larry English>Thank you.</v>

00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:01.000
<v Larry English>And so this is not a new function and I want to point out this is the most important part of the organization chart.</v>

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:04.850
<v Larry English>This is the core engine that keeps the company running at.</v>

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:07.180
<v Larry English>This is what has been in place all along.</v>

00:34:07.190 --> 00:34:14.940
<v Larry English>These leaders make decisions for their day to day operations of their area, and they do it in conjunction with the SLT member, obviously.</v>

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:22.720
<v Larry English>But they're really responsible for making the organization work, so that was fast.</v>

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:31.590
<v Larry English>A couple of things to to kind of remind everybody, we've been operating this way since roughly the beginning of the year.</v>

00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.310
<v Larry English>I think it's working really well.</v>

00:34:33.540 --> 00:34:40.690
<v Larry English>As I mentioned, there's a 300 line racy that supports this with clear accountability responsibility.</v>

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.080
<v Larry English>The the items that you would see in Tracy chart and I think we're going to finalize that and get that out.</v>

00:34:45.090 --> 00:34:49.590
<v Larry English>So everybody can see that and just general comments, we've never been about hierarchy.</v>

00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:52.520
<v Larry English>So anybody can still call anybody.</v>

00:34:52.760 --> 00:35:06.090
<v Larry English>No task is beneath anybody in the organization, so I I love it when people call me and and give me feedback or ideas and that open door policy applies to every leader in the organization.</v>

00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:17.640
<v Larry English>But we were clearly getting to the sides where we needed a traditional art chart that where clarity was provided and expected, and we needed this to execute effectively.</v>

00:35:17.650 --> 00:35:22.870
<v Larry English>And so this org chart that we just went through is really intended to help us grow to 400 million or more.</v>

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:32.840
<v Larry English>We'll continue to tweak it if something isn't working, but I think that I feel really good that we have the right structure in place to scale the company.</v>

00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.290
<v Larry English>So thank you, Maurice.</v>

00:35:36.620 --> 00:35:37.310
<v Maurice Faison>Thank you.</v>

00:35:36.390 --> 00:35:37.370
<v Larry English>Hopefully everybody still awake.</v>

00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.290
<v Maurice Faison>Ohh yeah, yeah, we're we're we're locked into that.</v>

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:41.130
<v Maurice Faison>Thanks.</v>

00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:41.850
<v Maurice Faison>Thanks, Larry.</v>

00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.330
<v Maurice Faison>So now we're gonna move from the org model to our operational focus and financial messaging.</v>

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:51.170
<v Maurice Faison>And so it would Kemp and Matt Hounds.</v>

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:52.310
<v Maurice Faison>Thank you.</v>

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.170
<v Maurice Faison>We'll start with Emily.</v>

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:58.150
<v Maurice Faison>Who's going to share our 2024 forecast? Emily?</v>

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.010
<v Emily Kemp>Eight.</v>

00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:00.450
<v Emily Kemp>Yeah.</v>

00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:10.710
<v Emily Kemp>Larry thinks that talking about the org model is boring and dry, but sometimes I think Matt and I get even the better topic.</v>

00:36:10.980 --> 00:36:17.070
<v Emily Kemp>So finance and operations, so we will try to not make this extremely boring for folks.</v>

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:19.490
<v Emily Kemp>But Abby, if you wanna go to the next slide.</v>

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:39.510
<v Emily Kemp>So if you if you joined us in January, we held a town hall meeting at the end of January kind of talking about our 2023 performance and you know, unfortunately 2023 started off and looked like it was going to be another really good year for us.</v>

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:45.240
<v Emily Kemp>We had a very solid quarter, one probably one of our our best quarter one performances.</v>

00:36:45.690 --> 00:36:55.370
<v Emily Kemp>Unfortunately, to be followed by somewhat of a declining quarter too, and then probably the worst performance in our quarter three history.</v>

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:02.010
<v Emily Kemp>So unfortunately, 2023 really was kind of a disappointing, I think in challenging year for us.</v>

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.250
<v Emily Kemp>We've talked about that before.</v>

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.990
<v Emily Kemp>It's not unique to Centric.</v>

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:10.500
<v Emily Kemp>There were so many service firms that went through the exact same circumstances.</v>

00:37:10.510 --> 00:37:13.270
<v Emily Kemp>We were dealing with, you know, we sell it in.</v>

00:37:13.380 --> 00:37:15.330
<v Emily Kemp>There were lots of layoffs and nouns.</v>

00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:24.880
<v Emily Kemp>It was challenging to keep up with client demand shrinking client demand that is so, you know, just a lot of challenges to work through throughout the year.</v>

00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:35.170
<v Emily Kemp>The good thing with going through a challenging year like that is just like, you know, Larry kind of alluded to, our our business is changing.</v>

00:37:35.180 --> 00:37:49.130
<v Emily Kemp>It's growing that that growth is changing the needs that we have as a business and that was, you know, there were a lot of good lessons learned coming out of 23 and that's what we're kind of focused on going into 2024.</v>

00:37:49.320 --> 00:38:05.080
<v Emily Kemp>So there's really, you know, I would call two goals that we have coming into 2024 and those are focused around kind of resetting our financial model to bring greater visibility and transparency across our our matrix model.</v>

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.660
<v Emily Kemp>And if you think about our our matrix model right now, we have business units, industry verticals, service offerings.</v>

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:13.580
<v Emily Kemp>We have offshore with centric India.</v>

00:38:14.310 --> 00:38:27.250
<v Emily Kemp>There's, there's a lot of moving pieces to that, and when you're dealing and navigating through a challenging time, the the better the transparency, the more timely the data, the better you can react.</v>

00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:29.650
<v Emily Kemp>And that was what we learned in 2023.</v>

00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:39.770
<v Emily Kemp>We need to get better at all of those things, transparency into what's really driving the root issues and then ultimately we need the data to be more timely than it is today.</v>

00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:48.920
<v Emily Kemp>So as we started to think about what our 2024 goal is gonna look like and Abby, you can go ahead and throw that number on the slide.</v>

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:59.600
<v Emily Kemp>The first thing that we kind of looked at in 2024 was we're changing the way we're actually setting.</v>

00:39:00.170 --> 00:39:02.300
<v Emily Kemp>Well, that's probably not completely accurate.</v>

00:39:02.310 --> 00:39:13.060
<v Emily Kemp>We're not necessarily changing the way we're setting the goal, but we did change the functionality and we changed the process for how we are collecting that revenue goal.</v>

00:39:13.310 --> 00:39:34.470
<v Emily Kemp>So historically, we've put a lot of a lot of heavy Excel manual processes to collect our annual plan data and this year was the first year that we were able to use a tool, every business unit, lead service offering, lead account manager, they're going in and they're providing a revenue goal at an account level.</v>

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:49.150
<v Emily Kemp>So for every client there's a sales goal based on you know what they know or what they're expecting from that client, and that rolls up into a total top line revenue number of 216 million.</v>

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.200
<v Emily Kemp>So that's the first thing.</v>

00:39:52.630 --> 00:40:01.580
<v Emily Kemp>This new functionality within CRM is also gonna give us more visibility into maybe where we're seeing, you know, maybe issues with clients.</v>

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:12.240
<v Emily Kemp>So if we were expecting a client to do two or three million in revenue and we're seeing that decline throughout the year, it kind of gives us an early warning sign of what we think the rest of the year is going to look like.</v>

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:12.710
<v Emily Kemp>Yeah.</v>

00:40:13.770 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Emily Kemp>The second thing that we're gonna that we wanna continue to focus on and and what we wanna make sure we're always keeping a very hyper focus on is is continued rock solid delivery and I actually I did not realize that the good news stories were gonna be shared around ages and secura but you know that it's a perfect example we have been with D PNL and AES since 2019 99 umm so it it just goes to show that you know the the most competitive advantage that we have with our clients is going to be you know.</v>

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:55.080
<v Emily Kemp>Solid delivery.</v>

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:25.790
<v Emily Kemp>Opens the door to expand to, you know, bring in new service offerings and that's exactly what we want to continue to focus on. Matt and Dionne talked yesterday about specific areas of our growth that we want to focus on in 24. And you know, those are obviously very hot items in the market, cyber and AI. And then you know heavy, heavy leaning into our partnerships with Microsoft sales force.</v>

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.190
<v Emily Kemp>And NetSuite as well.</v>

00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:44.320
<v Emily Kemp>And then lastly, you know what are we looking at? I think every business right now is kinda going through the same, you know navigating through the same challenges and we're doing very similar review, just making sure that our cost structure is in line with where we want to go.</v>

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:58.680
<v Emily Kemp>That we're right sized for the goals that we want to achieve in the future that we've got, you know that we're doing the best that we can with what we have. And Matt, how's is going to talk here in a minute.</v>

00:41:59.050 --> 00:42:11.130
<v Emily Kemp>Really, how we're going to make this work from an operational standpoint to make sure it aligns and it that we can maximise really our financial performance not only in 2024 but in future years as well.</v>

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:18.330
<v Emily Kemp>So Abby, you can go to the next slide.</v>

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:22.100
<v Emily Kemp>Nouns. I think this is you.</v>

00:42:21.690 --> 00:42:51.810
<v Matt Haunz>Alright, I think this is me. So let me give a quick kind of review in terms of kind of our key priorities for 2024 as it relates to finance and operations, we'll do a little bit more of a deep dive on the top two. So deploy operational and financial cost improvements as well as the CBA two point OS cut out what's going on with that. The bottom 2 on here, which is kind of really around staffing utilisation and bench management, there'll there will be more to come on that. I think coming in.</v>

00:42:52.170 --> 00:43:24.890
<v Matt Haunz>April and Jen Barnes is leading that effort for us. And then we've we've actually made some pretty good progress on the 4th 1 here, which is automate new performance scorecards and metrics. This is one that's been kind of on the on the books for a while, it was it was Acba 2.0 recommendation which we'll talk about here in a second as well. And I think we are looking at getting our first kind of automated scorecard out for B us before the end of the month. So excited to have that kind of demos point having that insight that that perspective.</v>

00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:28.010
<v Matt Haunz>More real time people understand, sort of what they're being measured against.</v>

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:43.400
<v Matt Haunz>Those things I think will help us get better insights in the business and making decisions as well. So those are those are you know, key things for us to make sure we kind of keep in mind as we continue to evolve and and and try to achieve our growth plan as Larry Laed out as well.</v>

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:46.080
<v Matt Haunz>Next slide please.</v>

00:43:49.220 --> 00:44:19.820
<v Matt Haunz>All right, so really the the question we always get is sort of what are we putting in, what are we putting in place and how do we think about our kind of mindset around the this the change that's happening and we kind of said hey, the way to look at this is is sort of these four kind of different dimensions. So simplify standardised scale and automate and the thinking here is you know as we think about complexities in the business and sometimes it's you you, you put complexities in not knowing that they're they're going to be complex down the road. So think about it when you're smaller it's it seems very simple but as you scale.</v>

00:44:20.060 --> 00:44:36.460
<v Matt Haunz>It makes it more complex, so part of what we've we've done and you've probably seen some of this is just the idea of removing complexities from our operations, including finance, where we can, right. So it's really China as we understand the business, understand how we can simplify. That's that's something that we're trying to really focus on.</v>

00:44:36.980 --> 00:44:50.660
<v Matt Haunz>The standardised side of things, and that's an interesting one as well. There's there's lots of, there's lots of things people can talk about in terms of why standardisation is good and there's always a balance between, you know, being standard with everybody else as well as sort of, you know, keeping and maintaining what makes.</v>

00:44:51.180 --> 00:45:23.380
<v Matt Haunz>Things the right things in centric, unique. So we're trying to standardise the right practises looking at kind of industry, industry, best practises and benchmarks and understanding where we need to align to that it it does. I mean there's there's reasons why there are best practises and for us to you know be foolish for us to think that we've got a better way to to do things in in every case. So trying to do a better job of understanding what the best practises are and which of those things we can adopt and standardise within centric the third one around automate and and really this is this is the the idea of continuing to do kind of more with less.</v>

00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:57.060
<v Matt Haunz>You know, we run a a pretty lean operation overall for both finance and operations in general. We use that. We do use RP and other types of tools to allow us to get better and more efficient and we're also exploring the use of AI as a as a way to enhance some of the activities that we do or replace some of those activities using AI functionality. So an example of that, it would be if you guys are wondering, are things like the, you know, we've moved to the new timesheets or the new buckets with an open air and the auto approval for those that used to have, you know, 70 things so many times she used to approve.</v>

00:45:57.350 --> 00:46:01.430
<v Matt Haunz>Should have far, far less of that now, and that's because we're using kind of this auto approve.</v>

00:46:03.230 --> 00:46:30.870
<v Matt Haunz>Functionality for non billable internal time and then lastly around the scale. So this is this is critical 'cause you know there you mentioned this as well is just you know trying to get to a $400 million plus company you know we have to do the right things around how we how we look at our simplification we got to the right things around standardisation and automation but we got to build a platform to scale and that's got to really enable our future growth and it's got to be done not just sort of the platform but it's got to be done efficiently you know from an operations perspective so.</v>

00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:35.340
<v Matt Haunz>That mindset, you know, the kind of those four key pillars, if you will or or or.</v>

00:46:37.260 --> 00:47:01.740
<v Matt Haunz>Levers. That's really how we're looking at kind of running the business and how we make decisions and the things that we want to do both in terms of changes within the current structure and how we want to evolve over time as well. The other thing I would just mention that I think's critically important here is and and I think everyone on this call has seen it. We've, we've done a lot of change in 2 1/2 months and Emily will go through some of the things that we've already done within the finance area specifically.</v>

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:29.140
<v Matt Haunz>But things like in irrationalizing, the open air tasks we've made changes the the P and LS truck structure removed internal internal cost transfers and and there's still other changes we're planning to make throughout the year. So this is this is a lot for everyone to absorb it's and it's everybody from each of you, our leaders, everybody, we got to just make sure we're doing those things and we're doing them intentionally. We're moving fast. We feel like it's one of those things where.</v>

00:47:30.760 --> 00:48:00.040
<v Matt Haunz>Speed's important, but we don't do it recklessly, so there's gonna be a balance there in terms of how we strike the right perspective on getting these changes in place but not putting our business at risk. At the same time. So one thing I would ask for this group is just just patience. This is going to be a year of transition. We're working through a lot of changes. We're not going to get it right or perfect out of the gate, but it won't be for lack of trying. We're going to make some missteps and if we see those, we're going to correct them, you know, feel free to help us if you see that stuff happening.</v>

00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:04.920
<v Matt Haunz>But just, you know, just give us the chance to to kind of work through these as we go through the rest of the year.</v>

00:48:05.310 --> 00:48:15.870
<v Matt Haunz>And I think our our at the end of the road when we're kind of through this, I think our ability to do and and grow and scale and meet our our long term growth objectives will be in a much better spot.</v>

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:46.240
<v Maurice Faison>Thanks, Matt. Speaking of changes, so last Thursday, hopefully you all saw the e-mail regarding the timesheet change that Matt talked about. And so this is, you know, one of the first communications around moving to weekly timesheet rollout, which is just one of the changes that's going to support this evolution in some of our broader operational changes. And so Emily is going to cover in a little bit more detail the landscape of the changes that are going to be happening this year.</v>

00:48:49.290 --> 00:48:50.610
<v Emily Kemp>Yep, so.</v>

00:48:51.690 --> 00:49:18.570
<v Emily Kemp>So you know, Matt said we we have already made quite a bit of change that was rolled out. This really starting with the January financials and part of the reason that we're moving some of this so quickly is that you know from a financial standpoint, if you can get all of those changes in at the beginning of the year, it makes the rest of the year a whole lot easier. It also makes reporting a lot more easier to follow. So there was a tonne of.</v>

00:49:19.231 --> 00:49:25.061
<v Emily Kemp>And then to kind of getting those things complete and ready to be rolled out January 1st.</v>

00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:33.971
<v Emily Kemp>So the three items that have been completed, you know Matt already mentioned, but you know we're making changes to how we're measuring our our gross profit.</v>

00:49:34.321 --> 00:49:44.951
<v Emily Kemp>We're making changes to how we're measuring our service offering financials and then the big one that really impacts everyone is we standardized kind of the time entry.</v>

00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:51.771
<v Emily Kemp>So just an example of some of that simplification that we're trying to drive and we started working on this.</v>

00:49:52.201 --> 00:50:02.131
<v Emily Kemp>I think it was back in October, there were roughly 495 internal projects that people were charging time to that list now is down to about 50.</v>

00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:12.631
<v Emily Kemp>So a ton of, you know, simplification and I will say kind of my new tagline is that it is not simple to simplify.</v>

00:50:12.901 --> 00:50:19.481
<v Emily Kemp>And so you know the the finance team on it as well, they they worked really hard to try to get that too.</v>

00:50:19.901 --> 00:50:24.591
<v Emily Kemp>A simplified model that was still meaningful and providing the right level of value.</v>

00:50:25.421 --> 00:50:26.631
<v Emily Kemp>All of these changes.</v>

00:50:26.641 --> 00:50:34.171
<v Emily Kemp>There's two goals that were working to achieve and one of them is I I kind of liked what Matt was saying, right?</v>

00:50:34.181 --> 00:50:45.711
<v Emily Kemp>It's like, you know, as time has gone on, you know something that didn't seem complicated when we put it in place to begin with is now more complicated because of the size.</v>

00:50:46.461 --> 00:51:02.601
<v Emily Kemp>The more people are involved with that, So what we're really trying to do is we want to align our financial model model to a more industry standard and those those things are you know what I just mentioned, gross profit, SO financial and and standardize time entry.</v>

00:51:02.771 --> 00:51:05.401
<v Emily Kemp>But then the other one is we're really working.</v>

00:51:05.411 --> 00:51:19.001
<v Emily Kemp>The end goal is to really be able to achieve a much faster month end close than we do today and you know the value of that is obviously being able to get financial results and and numbers and analysis out much sooner than we do today.</v>

00:51:19.011 --> 00:51:21.231
<v Emily Kemp>So again that we can react to it more quickly.</v>

00:51:22.661 --> 00:51:35.711
<v Emily Kemp>What's coming and what Maurice just made mention of is the very next change that we're working on is the weekly time entry that is going to go into effect in April, followed by starting in January.</v>

00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:46.211
<v Emily Kemp>We're going to move our payroll cycle from a semi monthly, you know being paid twice a month to a biweekly payroll schedule, which will be every other week.</v>

00:51:46.261 --> 00:51:51.341
<v Emily Kemp>So there will be lots of details on all of that and communications forthcoming.</v>

00:51:51.891 --> 00:51:59.141
<v Emily Kemp>But the first thing is really focusing on getting everyone aligned to weekly time entry and the weekly timesheet process.</v>

00:52:01.931 --> 00:52:04.291
<v Emily Kemp>And I think we could go to the next slide.</v>

00:52:04.301 --> 00:52:04.701
<v Emily Kemp>Abby.</v>

00:52:06.051 --> 00:52:08.871
<v Emily Kemp>So this is the communication that was sent out last week.</v>

00:52:10.791 --> 00:52:17.681
<v Emily Kemp>And so instead of doing the like today, our timesheet process follows our payroll cycle, which is twice a month.</v>

00:52:17.871 --> 00:52:24.881
<v Emily Kemp>And so we're moving to weekly, which would mean every Friday, we're gonna ask that everybody submit their timesheet.</v>

00:52:25.091 --> 00:52:29.021
<v Emily Kemp>We're asking that that those hours be approved every Monday.</v>

00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:39.101
<v Emily Kemp>We're also strongly encouraging that people enter their time daily, you know, really daily time entry is best practice and improves accuracy, quality of the data.</v>

00:52:39.751 --> 00:52:44.541
<v Emily Kemp>But we realized like getting that every day may be a little bit too much.</v>

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:52.441
<v Emily Kemp>So what we're we highly encourage everyone in our time daily and the again this goes into effect starting April 1st.</v>

00:52:52.451 --> 00:52:58.231
<v Emily Kemp>And so the very first weekly timesheet will be due end of day on April 5th.</v>

00:53:00.001 --> 00:53:03.711
<v Emily Kemp>And there will be many more communications coming from this.</v>

00:53:03.721 --> 00:53:13.981
<v Emily Kemp>So, you know, stay tuned and make sure that you know you're checking your emails and that you're looking for the great communications that the OCM team has helped us with.</v>

00:53:15.811 --> 00:53:16.861
<v Maurice Faison>Alright, thanks.</v>

00:53:17.131 --> 00:53:17.461
<v Maurice Faison>OK.</v>

00:53:17.471 --> 00:53:24.121
<v Maurice Faison>One last area we want to update everyone on is around our centric business architecture journey.</v>

00:53:24.471 --> 00:53:31.151
<v Maurice Faison>And so, Matt, would you give us an update on the project that we affectionately call CBA?</v>

00:53:31.371 --> 00:53:33.441
<v Maurice Faison>2.0, What's happened to date?</v>

00:53:33.451 --> 00:53:35.661
<v Maurice Faison>What can we expect for the rest of this year?</v>

00:53:36.431 --> 00:53:37.081
<v Matt Haunz>For sure.</v>

00:53:37.091 --> 00:53:39.461
<v Matt Haunz>So I know this has been a question for a while.</v>

00:53:39.471 --> 00:53:46.971
<v Matt Haunz>It's been kind of on the on the depth chart in terms of things you want to look at is in terms of priorities.</v>

00:53:46.981 --> 00:53:59.851
<v Matt Haunz>So if you think about what we did in 23 and kind of what what we're doing from a CBA perspective and the journey as as as Maurice points out, really trying to make sure we're planning for the future.</v>

00:53:59.861 --> 00:54:09.911
<v Matt Haunz>So as we've said before, you know what we said in place, you know 10152025 years ago and how we operate today, we need to relook at that and that's really what CBA is intended to do.</v>

00:54:09.921 --> 00:54:28.361
<v Matt Haunz>So not just looking at a specific part of the business, but it's the entire business from how we do, you know, Talent Acquisition, how we look at selling projects, how we look at positioning projects, how we sell those projects and how we wrap up those projects and the shared services and other functions, business enablement, it's underneath.</v>

00:54:28.371 --> 00:54:35.891
<v Matt Haunz>So CBA is very broad in scope, so it needs to evolve as our needs as our needs change as well.</v>

00:54:36.441 --> 00:54:37.001
<v Matt Haunz>Umm.</v>

00:54:37.601 --> 00:54:43.151
<v Matt Haunz>And the big thing is if you think about, you know, enabling growth, we just talked about that that's that's the intent here.</v>

00:54:43.161 --> 00:54:47.911
<v Matt Haunz>So over time is looking at we've got essentially 12 recommendations.</v>

00:54:47.921 --> 00:54:57.191
<v Matt Haunz>Key recommendations that came out of our initial design session that that occurred last year and we're actually making progress on a number of those.</v>

00:54:57.201 --> 00:55:01.601
<v Matt Haunz>So I'll kind of hit some of these and I'll go into a little more detail on what the current one that we're focused on as well.</v>

00:55:01.611 --> 00:55:04.331
<v Matt Haunz>So, you know, we've got three engagement types.</v>

00:55:04.341 --> 00:55:11.461
<v Matt Haunz>Those are solution based, role based and managed services or operational support services.</v>

00:55:11.471 --> 00:55:18.691
<v Matt Haunz>So enabling how we better engage on those three types, the focus right, you got right now is really on the solutioning side.</v>

00:55:18.701 --> 00:55:40.391
<v Matt Haunz>And again, I'll talk more about that here on the next slide, the other, the other ones here aligned defined roles and accountability and measures we mentioned about the new dashboards, operational dashboards that we're creating for OGS, starting with business units, but being able to better align to as a common set of rewards, making sure we all have similar goals and objectives.</v>

00:55:41.651 --> 00:55:49.441
<v Matt Haunz>That's well underway as well, which is again one of the top recommendations come out of CBA and then maturing our internal capabilities business capabilities.</v>

00:55:49.911 --> 00:55:51.881
<v Matt Haunz>We launched the beginning of this year in Jansen.</v>

00:55:51.891 --> 00:56:21.861
<v Matt Haunz>Meyers is is leading this effort around our business Transformation office and I think the the What people probably heard was you know used to be our kind of our old PMO structure, but it's basically elevated that entire function where it's really looking at enterprise wide, all the different initiatives not just sort of what's nationally led but also things that are being done with an operating groups as well and really trying to make sure that we understand what those changes are, how those overlap or distinct or or distinct or different and then really help us try to.</v>

00:56:21.961 --> 00:56:24.851
<v Matt Haunz>Prioritize and making sure work on the right things to achieve our goals.</v>

00:56:25.261 --> 00:56:35.431
<v Matt Haunz>One thing that was really enlightening, and I don't know the exact numbers and someone have them, but he's cataloged all these different initiatives and there's, I bet you there's fifty or more of those that have been identified.</v>

00:56:35.821 --> 00:56:42.711
<v Matt Haunz>You know, in terms of things that have either have or on the books to be done or currently underway and that's a lot to take on.</v>

00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:57.211
<v Matt Haunz>So really getting that overall portfolio view and being able to look at those and understand again which ones maybe we want to stop which ones you want to defer, which ones you want to accelerate or combine the view within the BTO is going to allow us to do a lot of that as well.</v>

00:56:57.721 --> 00:57:02.401
<v Matt Haunz>And then all this is being done as we talked about with the with the growth mindset and that was something else that came out of CBA.</v>

00:57:02.411 --> 00:57:10.881
<v Matt Haunz>As we got to look at this, not just sort of how we work today, but how we want to grow and evolve in the future and that's being addressed as part of the CBA journey as well.</v>

00:57:11.691 --> 00:57:13.481
<v Matt Haunz>So we go to the next slide please, Abby.</v>

00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:17.831
<v Matt Haunz>Alright, so just what are we?</v>

00:57:17.841 --> 00:57:17.971
<v Matt Haunz>What?</v>

00:57:17.981 --> 00:57:18.681
<v Matt Haunz>What's the what?</v>

00:57:18.691 --> 00:57:19.531
<v Matt Haunz>What are we doing today?</v>

00:57:19.541 --> 00:57:31.631
<v Matt Haunz>Right as in terms of CBA, what we tried to do is really chunk out these different these different 12 recommendations and sort of how do I approach them and the focus right now is really on looking at our solutioning function and what do we mean by that, right?</v>

00:57:31.641 --> 00:57:33.091
<v Matt Haunz>It's what are we trying to solve?</v>

00:57:33.101 --> 00:57:34.191
<v Matt Haunz>Why is this important?</v>

00:57:34.251 --> 00:57:39.631
<v Matt Haunz>And we all realize that an anchor of how our growth happened is related to service offerings.</v>

00:57:39.841 --> 00:57:48.451
<v Matt Haunz>There are linchpin in terms of our ability to sell project based work and we've seen the benefits of engaging them and how that's helped with our growth as well.</v>

00:57:48.981 --> 00:57:59.431
<v Matt Haunz>But it's really, you know, in order to meet our behag and really trying to solve our customers or clients toughest problems, we really need to make sure we're doing project based delivery really well.</v>

00:57:59.661 --> 00:58:13.231
<v Matt Haunz>And as we get more complex in terms of being able to knit together different types of service offerings, so not just sort of coming in and doing a DNA project, but also looking at it, maybe he has a Modern Workplace flavor to it and there's some OE involved.</v>

00:58:13.381 --> 00:58:41.741
<v Matt Haunz>You get these cross SO solutions we need to do and and if we now if we don't have a common way to deliver those and not just deliver but also sell and position them, it becomes increasingly hard to do that at scale it it it it can improve we you know we we have issues with potentially profitability at times because we we don't always work In Sync as people do things different ways we wanna make sure that we have the high client satisfaction and frankly our folks each of you that are doing delivery need to make sure.</v>

00:58:41.881 --> 00:58:45.731
<v Matt Haunz>That you feel comfortable that you're set up for success and the way we've got these designs.</v>

00:58:45.741 --> 00:58:52.391
<v Matt Haunz>So what's underway right now is we've got the detailed design fairly well, at least the first draft of that.</v>

00:58:52.581 --> 00:59:08.221
<v Matt Haunz>We're gonna look to present that to the Operations committee and then what we're doing right now is also looking at projects where we can begin to pilot some of the things that we've put together in terms of understanding if the things that we think will work or change for the better, how does actually work in practice.</v>

00:59:08.231 --> 00:59:20.241
<v Matt Haunz>So we're trying to take a very pragmatic approach to how we go about this and making sure that we can take learnings as part of the pilot, interject those back into the design and making sure we're continuing to refine.</v>

00:59:20.291 --> 00:59:25.611
<v Matt Haunz>So at the end of the day, the benefits are going to be we're going to be able to continue to solve our their clients.</v>

00:59:25.621 --> 00:59:28.111
<v Matt Haunz>Most complex problems bring in the full power of centric.</v>

00:59:29.941 --> 00:59:33.051
<v Matt Haunz>Making sure that as part of this, we have career opportunities for employees.</v>

00:59:33.061 --> 00:59:40.691
<v Matt Haunz>So think about being able to elevate and move into more of these complex solution types of delivery roles and then really differentiate centric.</v>

00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:47.611
<v Matt Haunz>So it's the idea of again leveraging service offerings, leveraging our tech, suing our Ivs and Centric India.</v>

00:59:47.621 --> 00:59:57.941
<v Matt Haunz>So being able to pull that together and tell a cohesive story that we can not just sort of talk about, but stand behind as well, that's really what we're driving for as part of this next phase of CBA.</v>

01:00:00.081 --> 01:00:00.431

<v Maurice Faison>There is a lot going on here and we are going to continue to hear from Matt and Emily and this group throughout the year with updates and as changes need to be rolled out a quick time check.</v>

01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:20.021
<v Maurice Faison>That is going to conclude a day two folks.</v>
